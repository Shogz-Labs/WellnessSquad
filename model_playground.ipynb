Different cultures, religions, and philosophical traditions offer various interpretations of the meaning of life. Some believe it is to seek happiness, fulfillment, or spiritual enlightenment, while others see it as a quest for knowledge, love, or contributing to the well-being of others.

Which is why evolution has hardwired three fundamental needs into us:need for controlneed for connectionneed for consistencyThese needs are still with us today. They drive everything we think, say, feel, decide and do. At the most basic level, they help us survive and reproduce. At a higher level, they set the scene, once we’ve answered them for any length of time, for conditions such as happiness, comfort, satisfaction or serenity.Why do people think, say, feel, decide and do the things they do? They’re answering three fundamental needs shared by all human beings: control, connection and consistency, or what I call the ‘3Cs of why’. The ‘3Cs of why’ helped our distant ancestors survive physically. Today they help us ‘survive’ psychologically. You’re about to learn more about them. Reading time: 15 minutes. Bonus: by addressing other people’s fundamental needs for control, connection and consistency, we can influence them more effectively.I’ve had a passion for influence factors and techniques for four decades and been implementing and/or teaching them—usually under the title ‘communication’—for well over half that. The 3Cs of why emerged almost accidentally from those activities. I didn’t discover them myself, of course, but I brought them together and decided to study the mix. What I’m offering here is a dispassionate, research-based way to interpret (and influence) human behaviour. It helps me every single day of my life and is enthusiastically received by the people I train. If you’re looking for religious leaps of faith or any form of spiritual guidance here, you won’t find them. What you will find are reasonable assumptions about how our distant ancestors thought and behaved, and humility about what most of us can achieve. The 3Cs of why > ContentsWhy are control, connection and consistency such fundamental needs in our lives?Psychological ‘survival’ has replaced physical survival as a priority for most of usOur need for control. A closer look.Our need for connection. A closer look.Our need for consistency. A closer look.Influencing others via their needs for control, connection and consistencyHow to explore your personal relationship with control, connection and consistencyWhat about happiness, comfort, satisfaction and serenity?What about the arts?What about religion?1. Why are control, connection and consistency such fundamental needs in our lives? Roll your mind back 20′000 years and consider the situation of our ancestors. To the best of our knowledge (and without getting into a debate about ‘how it all started’), evolution had already hardwired our ancestors for two things: survival and reproduction.Survival and reproduction depended in turn on our ancestors having access to food, sex, and shelter. But was it that simple? On closer inspection, sustainable access to food, sex and shelter depended on other things:Our ancestors needed food but they also needed it all year round, including during tough winters with snow on the ground. This meant they needed to find ways, however rudimentary, to store and protect their food. Those who didn’t died. Our ancestors thus needed to control their food supply.They felt urges to have sex, but sex didn’t happen just like that. Access to females was restricted by possessive (and aggressive) family and tribe members. If access to females wasn’t possible through violence, it had to be negotiated. This in turn required social skills, however rudimentary. Our ancestors thus needed to connect with each other. And not just for sex. Their ability to connect helped them band together for more efficient hunting and child-rearing purposes.Shelter could not be found, protected and shared without initiative, organization and social skills. Our ancestors needed both control and connection to achieve this.None of the above could have happened without our ancestors being able to identify and memorize consistent links between causes and effects or between clues and meaning. For example, they needed to work out that by keeping certain foods dry or cool, they could save it for later. An awareness of consistencies and an instinct to look for them were crucial to our ancestors’ ability to learn, reason, decide, remember and predict—indeed to think.Therefore control, connection and consistency were needs that were just as fundamental to our ancestors, if not more so, as food, sex and shelter. Evolution hardwired them as needs into us, too.All this was true 20′000 years ago. The kicker is that, thanks to evolution, our needs for control, connection and consistency still rule our lives today. They still drive just about everything we do, feel and think. Examples:ControlImagine a stranger walking up to you in the street, giving you 100 dollars and walking away without a word of explanation. Your surprise and perhaps a touch of paranoia will soon be replaced by satisfaction. Let’s assume you’re experiencing 50 units of satisfaction units.Now imagine a different stranger three years later. He walks up to you as you’re checking your wallet, snatches 100 dollars from it and runs away.Your initial surprise will soon be replaced by dissatisfaction. Logically, given that the sum of money is identical in both cases, you should be experiencing 50 units of dissatisfaction.But are you? If you think you’d be more dissatisfied in the second scenario than you were satisfied in the first, you’re not alone. Research has shown that our dissatisfaction at losing something is at least twice as high as our satisfaction at winning. This is our need for control (in this case our fear of losing it) at work.ConnectionYou’re sitting in a meeting. The boss has just explained his plan to solve a problem. You think it’s total bullshit. It will never work. That should be obvious to anyone.You look around, expecting to see looks on people’s faces that are at least as disapproving as yours. But you can’t see any. Everyone seems relaxed.So you raise your hand and politely tell the boss that you don’t think his plan will work. You give it to him straight, even though he’s a sensitive sort of guy. That’s what you would do, right?Wrong. You stay quiet. This is your need for connection at work. You don't want to stand out, to rock the boat. You decide that maintaining your connection with your colleagues and your boss — being a team player in today’s jargon — is more important than the truth.And even if you do have the courage to speak up, you won’t do so before experiencing a flash of doubt, of queasiness, of aversion to disconnection.ConsistencyShe says ‘yes’ to a dance with him. It goes well but nothing special.She says ‘yes’ to a drink.And ‘yes’ to another.In so doing, she also says ‘yes’ but without pronouncing the word to his curiosity by answering his cliché questions.When he first puts his hand on hers and tries to leave it there, she moves her hand away. That’s a ‘no’.But when he does it again, she doesn’t move her hand away. She is cringing but she leaves her hand nnder his. So ‘yes’.He manages a funny remark. She laughs. That’s a ‘yes’ to his humour.One final drink? Just a soda, she says. Another ‘yes’.Now they’re outside the bar and he’s offering to drive/walk her home. ‘Yes’ to that.More humour from his as they walk. More smiles from her. Not a ‘no’ in sight.Now she’s outside her home. He asks if he can kiss her.Yes or no? Strictly speaking, a kiss would have nothing to do with anything that went before. It’s unrelated. Yet somehow it is. A ‘no’ at this stage would seem to contradict, even though it doesn’t, all preceding responses and reactions—all those spoken and unspoken yesses. No one likes to be thought of as a flip-flopper.This kind of discomfort is our need for consistency at work. It’s the reason men and women stay in broken marriages. It’s the reason people keep on investing in lost causes. To suddenly say ‘no’ would be an admission that all previous decisions were mistakes.2. Psychological survival has replaced physical survivalOur needs for control, connection and consistency have evolved. They now express themselves differently. The main difference between our distant ancestors and ourselves is that 21st-century ‘survival’ is no longer a physical challenge for most of us. It’s a psychological one:threatening complexity has replaced threatening wildlifedying for something to eat has replaced dying from not eatingexposure to judgment has replaced exposure to elementsscarcity of meaning has replaced scarcity of anything elsethe tyranny of appearance has replaced the tyranny of subsistencecontagious loneliness has replaced contagious illnessThis switch from physical to psychological priorities has added levels of complexity to our survival and reproduction instincts. While our needs for control, connection and consistency still help us find food, sex and shelter, they now also drive us to:exploit 21st-century opportunities (where’s my start-up? Have you downloaded my app?)manage 21st-century threats (what do you mean, ‘no wifi’?)communicate and influence effectively (why did I get only 1 ‘like’ when I have 2538 ‘friends?’)keep up with whoever or whatever (where are the fortune and fame the world owes me just because I’m alive, connected, reachable, sharable and high on Adderall?)stay sane (where’s my antidepressant?)and, if there’s any time left, achieve whatever else we consider important, both for ourselves and those we care about.Answering our fundamental needs simultaneously, sustainably and (where legal and possible) enjoyably is a pre-condition for experiencing states such as satisfaction, happiness, comfort or serenity. On the other hand, whenever one or several of the needs goes unanswered or is threatened for any length of time, it quickly takes precedence in our lives and either taints, disrupts, destroys or slows down our other wants and needs. And it’s no surprise that countless techniques are on offer to help people with unanswered fundamental needs ‘take a step back’, ‘live in the moment’ or ‘see the bigger picture’- Let’s take a closer look at each of our three fundamental needs. 3. Our need for control. A closer look.Our need for control explains our attraction to things like knowledge, food, shelter, freedom, choice, power, possessions, contracts, insurance, mastery and safety. But it also explains our attraction to risk taking, fortune telling and novelty, all of which are opportunities, real or imagined, to test or improve our control. On the other hand, losing control over our life or indeed loss of any kind, whether real or potential (e.g. the prospect of scarcity), is something we avoid and act on. Loss of weight is an exception. 4. Our need for connection. A closer look.Our need for connection is fundamental because there is very little—including reproduction, of course—that we can achieve alone. Evolution has hardwired us to assume we stand a better chance of surviving by collaborating with others, reciprocating and being sociable (watch how newborn babies instinctively attract attention, for instance). As groups we can produce more food, build safer shelters and defend each other. Attraction, seduction and sexual desire are among the most obvious manifestations of our need to connect. By making them pleasurable, evolution has increased the chances that we’ll have sex and produce, in many cases, descendants. But producing children isn’t enough. It takes a tribe, including its homosexual members, to raise them. Besides connecting with other people, we need to feel connected to the world around us, to what we do in it, to what events and things mean, to who we are and to who we might become (self-actualization). This is why emotions and stories, not facts and numbers, resonate so deeply with us. On the other hand, isolation or exclusion, whether real or potential, are forms of disconnection we instinctively fear and may go to extremes to avoid. They explain our reluctance to disobey authority and the darker sides of groupthink and conformity. 5. Our need for consistency. A closer look.Our need for consistency supports our needs for control and connection. How can we spot threats to our control and connections? How can we spot opportunities to test and improve them? By constantly checking our surroundings for breaks in the consistencies we know about. Consciously or not, we spend most of our waking hours filling gaps, spotting patterns, finding or inventing explanations for things (scientific explanations, religious explanations…), drawing conclusions, identifying truths, learning stuff and establishing rules. Consistency underpins all these things and our appetite for it is unlimited. On any given day, we look for consistency between:clues and meaningpatterns and meaningthoughts and other thoughtsthoughts and actscurrent acts or thoughts and previous onesour self of yesterday and the one of today (persistentce of identity)our ideal self and the one we show (appearances)our behaviour and applicable rules of any kind, written or unwrittennew information and existing knowledge (learning)cause and effectchoices or judgments to be made and mental shortcuts (also known as cognitive biases or heuristics, e.g. ‘he’s good-looking and therefore trustworthy’ or ‘he has the same first name as me and is therefore likable’)expectations and realityThe world might seem to be in a turmoil of change, but most of life is actually consistent. We know from observation and learning that the same causes have the same effects and that reality in its millions of tiny details is mostly consistent with our expectations. And it remains so from one minute, day or month to the next. This offers a crucial advantage: anything or anyone we know to be consistent in some way can be safely ignored in most cases. This in turn frees up our mind to pay attention to inconsistencies. These signal either threats to our control and connections or opportunities to improve them. 6. Influencing others via their needs for control, connection and consistencyIf you want to make your communication more effective and influence others, think about how you could reword or restructure your messages so that they answer one or several of people’s three fundamental needs. Examples:Control: ‘This project will increase our margin for manœuvre and keep our future options open. It will give us access to new markets. Any objections to all this freedom?’Control: ‘If we don't do this, we’ll miss out on new opportunities. We’ll lose customers and suppliers. You wouldn’t want us to damage the trust of our shareholders, would you?’Connection: ‘I know this change is not a comfortable prospect for you and you’ll be leaving dear colleagues and friends behind. But you’ll be surrounded by people who care and who’ll make you feel at home. I will call you every week to check on progress. Does that sound like loneliness to you?’Connection: ‘Are you sure you disagree? Everyone else is aligned on this and we’re ready to go. Are you a teamplayer or not? Why all the fuss?’Note: only use this approach if the person in question is clearly disrupting for disruption’s sake or trying to attract attention to themselves. It they genuinely (and bravely) believe they’re right, give them a chance. It’s not because one person disagrees that everyone else is right.Connection: ‘Let me share a story that will make things clearer.”Connection: ‘Automation will remove the boring, unrewarding aspects of your work and allow you to focus on the meaningful, value-adding ones.’Connection: ‘We need your opinion on this.’Consistency: ‘There will be changes, of course, but look at what’s not changing: our values, our mission, your working conditions.’Consistency: ‘There’s a contradiction here. I think our customers and colleagues deserve clarity, don't you? They’re already experiencing a lot of ambiguity in their day-to-day work.’Consistency: ‘This is important to you. You said that this is what you want. Is there something I havent’ understood?’7. How to explore your personal relationship with control, connection and consistencyEvery single one of our thoughts, feelings, reactions, decisions and behaviours can be explained in terms of one or several of the three needs. That is why, regardless of whether things are going well or not for you, it’s worth exploring what the three needs mean to you personally:Do you feel in control of your life? If so, is it a liberation for you? If not, why not? If you don’t feel in control of your life, start by identifying what you cannot control. Then commit to wasting as little time as possible on it. Focus instead on what you can control: feelings, reactions, alternatives…If your lack of control is getting you down, make a written list of all the things you do control. Most of them are tiny: what clothes you wear, tea or coffee, this direction or that one, this snack or that one, this toilet or that one… As the list gets longer, it will quickly provide perspective.If your lack of control is turning into fear, describe your feelings to yourself. If possible, do it aloud or in writing. Go into minute details (‘I’m feeling shit-scared right now because…’). Putting words on feeings is a first step towards controlling them.If your lack of control is due to overload, identify every single day just one task that you will complete. The task can be a tiny one, but make its completion non-negotiable.Are you trapped in a kind of control cycle? Is control all that matters to you? Are you obsessed with avoiding mistakes and imperfections? If so, aren’t you also failing to answer your need for connection or damaging the connections, especially family ones, you have? You’re not alone. Read on.Do you feel connected to other people in meaningful, positive and candid ways? If not, why not? How much effort do you put into quality connections with other people?Tip: here’s a simple way to connect with someone you don't know. Make a statement and immediately ask a related question. For example, ‘Hello. I couldn’t help noticing your [name of object]. It’s lovely. Can I ask you where you got it?’ The question kills off any embarrassment triggered by the statement.Do you feel disconnected or evenexcluded? A simple way to connect with people who are excluding you is to ask them to lend you something insignificant and not costly. If they refuse to do you such a minor favour, there’s no hope. Forget or ignore them. If they do accept (which they will in 99% of cases), their brains will need to justify that decision to themselves, which means finding something positive about you. That something is likely to blossom because of their need for consistency.If you’re feeling disconnected in general, make a written list of all the people you are connected with in ways that aren’t just digital: friends, neighbours, colleagues, customers, family. That list will be longer than you expect. It will give you perspective.Do you feel connected to yourself? Do you feel useful? Does life have meaning to you? If it doesn’t, there’s a good chance that one or both of your two other fundamental needs, control and consistency, are not being answered. Read on.If you were asked to measure how connected you feel on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 means completely disconnected, what score would you give yourself? Think about it before reading on. Now a second question: why didn’t you give yourself a lower score?Are you trapped in a connection cycle? Connection can be tyrannical if used to pressure you (or used by you to pressure yourself). You’ll know this is happenng if you’re tempted to agree with something wrong just because you don't want to damage your connections with the people around you. An effective way to break such a cycle is to avoid disagreeing via statements. Hide your criticism behind questions and requests for clarification and details.How predictable or consistent is your life?If it’s too consistent, introduce deliberate inconsistencies into it. Take a different route to work. Eat one hour later. Switch off the TV. Go into a forest and yell. Inconsistencies wake our brain up. Prepare to be surprised.If your life is perpetually unpredictable or inconsistent, force one or two non-negotiable habits, even tiny ones, into it. If the habits are fun, so much the better.Are you trapped in a consistency cycle? Consistency can be tyrannical, especially when it traps us into investing relentlessly in lost causes or repeatedly turning a blind eye to unacceptable behaviour. In such cases we worry more about appearing inconsistent to others (and to ourselves) than about doing the right thing and having the courage to say ‘no’ after a series of ‘yesses’.What is non-negotiable in your life? If you haven’t thought about this question before, it’s worth exploring it for a few days. There are many more answers than you think. But you’re so used to those things being non-negotiable that you don't notice them anymore. Your answers say a lot about who you are. And it’s worth remembering that true progress either depends on a non-negotiable becoming negotiable (think flat Earth) or a non-negotiable remaining that way despite colossal, life-threatening pressure (think Rosa Parks or Nelson Mandela).8. What about happiness, comfort, serenity and satisfaction?There is little evidence that happiness, comfort, serenity and satisfaction are fundamental human needs. They are possible but not guaranteed consequences of our three fundamental needs being answered. They might be desirable, of course, but they are secondary. 9. What about the arts? Here again there is little or no evidence to suggest that art in all its forms is a fundamental human need. Survival and reproduction can occur without it. But the arts act as powerful (and mostly safe) reflections of, reminders of and challenges to our three fundamental needs. The arts invite us to play around with them:They challenge or break down existing forms of control and explore new ones (pop art, abstract art and and novels such as Orwell’s ‘1984’ comes to mind).They do likewise with all types of connection (music, modern sculpture and literature come to mind).They challenge consistencies that we take for granted, suggest different relationships between causes and effect,s and explore new levels of meaning (poetry and paintings such as Velazquez’s ‘Las Meninas’ come to mind).10. What about religion?I believe that a combination of the Big Bang and evolutionary theory is the most reasonable, evidence-based explanation for why we’re here.For most of history, religion and gods have answered our need for consistency. Whenever something couldn’t be explained by a close examination of nature, the will of a divinity conveniently — or should I say miraculously — filled the gap. A divinity that no one had ever met personally but whose intentions had been revealed with blinding clarity to ‘someone else’.Most of our ancestors lived miserable, unpredictable and short lives.

      "Message Whenever I went through Hell, I figured out the meaning of life.When I was jobless : I was a fresher when I went to do my MBA from IIM-I; like 99% of the MBA aspirants, there was only one goal - to get the highest paying job. Miraculously I got one! But it was in an African country, I came running back within 2 months of joining & then the unemployment phase begin. I went through Hell, searching for jobs, thinking I f*cked up my one & only campus placement, crazily applied for just any job, did one low-level (B.Com) job for 3 months, thinking I ended my career before it even started. But I did not give up! I kept giving interviews, faced rejections but pushed through & finally under 2–3 months I got the job I deserved. After all of this, I realised, there was no point of putting unnecessary pressure on myself for campus placements when life can get royally f*cked anytime without any warning.When I was obese : While I was preparing for CAT, I had a strict schedule, 9am–5pm engineering college, CAT coaching 6pm–8pm, some dinner & TV till 9pm and then self-study till midnight. Despite all of this, morning 6am-8am slot was booked for physical fitness, I went bonkers with 6km running, pilates, pushups and what not. The life at IIM-I messed it all up, no eating/sleeping/exercising schedule; I entered at 42kg and graduated with 70kg. I was looking very unhealthy on the outside and very low in confidence on the inside. Decided to lose the extra fat, walked 14,000 steps everyday, my feet used to hurt like hell, I used to cry, but I pushed through and after 2 f*cking years lost zero (0) weight. Just when I was on the verge of giving up, I realised, I had no other option but to keep following healthy practices (with or without any results) & just leave it on time.When I had troubles in my marriage : Since this is personal let’s just keep it short. As a person who truly believes in “live & let others live”, I suddenly found myself surrounded with vicious women who had no other pastime than saying hurtful words and manipulating others. Obviously like all the men, my spouse was either ignorant about/ tried to ignore this politics within the family which was emotionally affecting me. Again, I was going through hell as I was trying to understand how the person who truly cared about me before marriage suddenly doesn’t give a damn about basic things like my respect & health (read sanity). I realised, I can neither stop nor distance myself from it for eternity & also why someone else has that kind of power over me that they can just throw me into depression any day? Instead, I’ve learnt to take my own stand now, I've stopped giving into manipulations and more importantly I’ve learnt to shift my focus on productive things rather than pointless bickering.So basically, for me, the meaning of life per se is NOTHING. We give it meaning by the way we live it, by :Neither taking too much pressure nor leaving everything on God (fate)Realising that we can never give up even if we desperately want toTaking our power back and leading our mind towards meaningful thingsCheers, AK has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

You want to die well. It’s the last thing you’ll ever do, so don’t screw it up. But dying well requires living well. And this leads us into the next question which, in my mind, is much more interesting because the answer is harder to get: what does it mean to live well? The answer to that question involves a lot of jumping back and forth between how you want to live and how you want to die, because each of those informs the other. This is highly personal, won’t work for everybody, everyone’s different, etc., but you might enjoy it. If you look at ancient philosophy, you’ll see that it’s preoccupied with “the good life”. This is in sharp contrast to modern philosophy. In modern philosophy, ethics is about conceptual analysis. The idea is that you write hundreds of pages where you fart around trying to define definitions that will define other definitions that let you define what right and wrong are so you can argue about their definitions. This is due to the professionalization of philosophy, which, in turn, is due to the trend toward specialization that has been evident since the scientific revolution. We have specialists for condensed matter physics and organic chemistry. We have specialists for welding and training German shepherd dogs. We have specialists for therapy and counseling. So surely, surely, we should also have specialists who can tell you what right and wrong are. Ancient philosophy, however, occurred in a period when the world was less abstract. The idea that you could solve every single problem by breaking it down into a subfields and assigning experts to each subfield was unheard of. Instead, ancient ethics asked this: what is “the good life”? It’s hard to define exactly what they meant by “the good life”. Any definition I would produce would certainly not be precise enough for analytic philosophers (nothing ever is), so I’m not gonna try to be rigorous here. But I can take a vague stab at it: the good life is the life that adequately prepares you for death. This is either a tautology or close to one, but tautologies can be elucidative even if they’re logically trivial. This leads back into how I want to die. So, what kind of life best prepares me for death? That depends on what state one wants to die in. I, personally, would like to die in a state of serenity where I feel that everything makes sense. Before I die, I want to make sure that I “get it”. That serenity is not entirely an internal thing. It’s also external, because it largely comes from the feeling of having fully expended my potential, and having done what I’m supposed to do. This leads back into how I should live. If I winnow down that last paragraph into two heads, I get two important things. First, my life has to involve a lot of learning, deep thought, and contemplation. Second, I need to have experiences that are transformative — and “transformative experience” doesn’t necessarily mean meditating in the woods or speaking with wizened old monks or traveling some place exotic. It can also mean having a worthwhile career that demands personal growth, or raising children, or taking care of my health. This leads back into how I want to die. I want to feel as if I no longer “owe” anything when I die. I’m still young and feel that I carry a lot on my shoulders. When I die, I want that weight to be gone. I want to feel that I said everything I should have said and did everything I should have done. This leads back into how I should live. We come into this life with a lot of debt, in some sense. The position I am in affords me certain opportunities. We all have natural capabilities, and some people have certain gifts. If I don’t use whatever meager capabilities I have, then I wasted my life. However, there is a danger here: it is possible to become so absorbed in day-to-day coping that I lose sight of the transcendent horizon at the end of my life, which means I won’t die well. This leads back into how I want to die. There are a lot of questions in me that need to be addressed, either by finding answers, or by making observations that dissolve the questions. The latter, ironically, turns out to happen more frequently. It is what it is. I’m a cerebral sort of person, so a big part of my energy goes into study. Little tidbits of meaning can emerge from studying computer science, or from being out and about identifying mushrooms. Insight can come from anywhere. When I die, I need those questions to be mostly answered. There must be silence in here, and the echoes must all have ceased. You may have sensed by now that this process can go on indefinitely. I could jump back and forth between “How shall I live?” and “What state do I want to die in?” as long as I want without ever coming to a final resolution. But that’s the key: this very process of jumping back and forth from where I am now and where I’ll be when I die has to form a big part of my life, until I’m ready to die. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message I know the meaning of life. It may sound shocking. But I say it with confidence. I know the meaning of life. Of course, I didn’t come up with it on my own. Many have answered this question before me. What do they have to say? Here are three of my favorites.Victor Frankl was a world-renowned neurologist and psychiatrist, as well as a philosopher in his own right. Frankl survived the Holocaust: he saw the absolute extremes of human cruelty. He was swallowed by evil incarnate, and he survived to tell the tale. In his book, Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl answers the question by flipping it on its head:Ultimately, man should should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.But he goes further. Frankl outlines three specific things that give life meaning:…the meaning of life always changes, but it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: 1. By creating a work or doing a deed; 2. By experiencing something or encountering someone; 3. By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.For Frankl, the meaning of life isn’t prescribed. It’s created. Each person’s life has its own unique, context-specific meaning. We may give meaning to our lives by creating, by experiencing, and by choosing our response to a situation, but it is we who must give that meaning.The existentialist thinker Jean-Paul Sartre took a similar tactic. For Sartre, there is no objective, all-encompassing meaning of life. There is no rubric. In other words:Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.But this doesn’t mean life is meaningless. In fact, in this void of objective meaning, every action becomes meaningful. In Sartre’s eyes, our actions create a meaning to life, and that meaning is whatever those actions define it to be. But my favorite answer is a lot less heady. Don’t get me wrong, I love the existentialists. I think they got at something beautiful. But when I answer the question “what is the meaning of life,” this is what I say:…the universe in general and playing in particular are, in a special sense,\"meaningless\": that is, they do not - like words and symbols - signify or point to something beyond themselves.This comes from the British philosopher Alan Watts, and I love it because it reveals the silliness of the question.Watts took much of his philosophy from Eastern wisdom traditions like Hinduism and Buddhism. For him, the entire effort to answer the meaning of life in words is ridiculous. Here he is again:People get all fouled up because they want the world to have meaning as if it were words...As if you had a meaning, as if you were a mere word, as if you were something that could be looked up in a dictionary. You are meaning.Viewed from this angle, the only sensible answer for the meaning of life is to recognize that it’s a nonsensical question. Trying to parse out a “meaning,” trying to find the moral of the story, is a fool’s errand. See how he finishes the quote above:[Life is] in a special sense,\"meaningless\": that is, [it does] not - like words and symbols - signify or point to something beyond [itself], just as a Mozart sonata conveys no moral or social message and does not try to suggest the sounds of wind, thunder, or birdsong.Trying to find the meaning of life with words is like trying to sing a song by describing it. You’re missing the point. If you want to know the meaning of life, sit for a while on an old wooden bridge above a calm stream in late autumn. Feel the cool breeze glide across your skin. Listen to the sounds of the forest, quietly singing to itself in birdsong. See how the light goes yellow, red, blue, purple as the sun dips down below the horizon. In this life, this is all the meaning you will ever get. But it is all the meaning that you could ever, ever need. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message My whole life, I did just like the flock of sheep. Following the rest blindly. Choosing a bad career path over and over again, I felt like giving up. I knew from the start this is not I was born for. This is not something that sparks joy into my life. Then what it is? I asked myself in consternation. When I had my child, I was constantly in the survival mode. To take care of him solely 24*7. I had no time to think about myself. I was pissed off. I regretted everything I ever did in my life. Each and every thing. After self loathing alot, I realised it's a waste of time. No matter what I do or how I do in my life, I have to survive and live my life. Then, why not go through the path that's fun and lively? I said to myself aloud. With so much of courage and trial and error, I found my true purpose of life. The meaning of my life. The meaning of life is to find the meaning of your life. It is in the form of many things in life. To find your passion and work deliberately towards it. To take care of your handicapped family member or to raise a child. To support your family financially. To help an elderly while he/she is crossing the road. To feed a meal to a homeless person. To help clean the environment by using eco friendly products. To read a meaningful book and follow it practically in your life from whatever you learn from it. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message What is the meaning of life? Why there is something? Why do we born to die? Why everything is always changing, nothing is constant? Do we really have free will or everything is predetermined? And may more….. It can’t be explained in few sentences. If u really wanted to know this so have some curiosity and patience, because patience and curiosity can lead you to new destination and the new answers. Even though many theories and proved explanations are available, I have tried to reach these answers through my own point of view. And I will try to explain all the questions by my own perspective. As we know that there is something, obviously as because we are the part of this something. Now there should be something prior to origin of something, otherwise how can something originate from nothing? But as this universe is made up of mass and energy, and this mass and energy are two different forms of same thing.As mass is mainly responsible for projection of something to us as “something”, Then energy could possibly be the foremost and fundamental form of something (mass as something). Now if energy (mass less particles) is the foremost and fundamental form of something then we also know that this energy is made of positive and negative charge. And if energy can be neutral then neutrality can create the energy. I believe that universe was also neutral before the big band, and the two fundamental forces as named 1- ISF (Inward spring force) with inward, constructive and gravitational quality, Where as 2- OSF (Outward spring force) with outward, destructive and repulsive quality.These forces were maintaining the universal neutrality, as they were equal and exact opposite forces. But constant struggle in between these two forces created the energy (mass less particles) and it eventually increased their struggle to maintain the universal neutrality. And at some point it was uncontrolled and unstable and the big bang happened which eventually created something from nothing. The theory of stability and law of universal neutrality explains in…… -“Origin of universe and life with the theory of stability and laws of universal neutrality” - “Absolute time, time dilation and three dimensions with pyramid model of universe through theory of stability and law of universal neutrality” Ok, if this is how something has created from nothing, then why do we born to die? To understand this we should understand the laws of universe which is implacable to every mass less and mass particle of this present universe. As was explained in previously, universe was originated and its series of changes are conducted under the two fundamental forces (ISF-inward spring force, OSF- outward spring force) which follow some fundamental laws of this universe as….. 1. CHANGE - change is the first law of universe which proceeds with time. 2. ABSOLUTE TIME - absolute time is the second law of universe, which can be assumed to understand the changes in consecutive frame. 3. CAUSALITY- causality is the third law of universe, which states that the changes happening with every fractional time span is the continuous forward step from past to present and the present to past. Where past is history, present is the true reality and future is always a mystery. 4. TRIAL AND ERROR - trial and error is the fourth law of this universe on the basis of universal basic fundamental forces (ISF, OSF) is struggling (creating and destroying) to regain stability and the universal neutrality back. 5. STABILITY AND NEUTRALITY - if the most and foremost important aim of the fundamental forces (mainly of ISF against OSF) of this universe to regain stability and the neutrality. If we observe every mass and mass less particles is trying to achieve stability and with every trial he is changing and evolving to face the next possible trial and error. As this universe is not conscious entity it couldn’t possible have planned all the journey to his destination but as universe is originated from neutrality became unstable from stability the final aim of universal forces must be to reach stability and the universal neutrality back. It is just like if we know our destiny but not the right way to reach there, then only the trial and error to every possible way, is only the option to reach our destiny. Universe is just trying to do so.Everything which we can observe in this existing universe is due to the trial and error. And the human kind and every living animal on this earth is just a trial and error of this universe. Now if we are just a trial and error of the universe under universal forces, then either all everything is predetermined or we have the free will? If we have clear with the ideas of ISF, OSF and their struggle to achieve the stability and universal neutrality back, as well as the fundamental laws of universe on which the whole universe is governing then it will be very easy to understand the concept of free will and the determinism. Even though we constantly feel our free will, it is very difficult to prove its existence and is very easy to prove that everything is determined.Now if we focus on the fundamental laws of universe we should understand the law of trial and error, as universe is not a conscious entity it don’t have the blue print or the fixed path to reach his final destiny of stability and universal neutrality. So the universe in the form of fundamental forces (ISF & OSF) constantly follows the trial and error to move forward in every fractional time frame. It indirectly says that even though everything is under the influence of universal laws, one of the universal law trial and error gives us the free will (option to choose).It means that even if everything is moving forward towards the predetermined aim, we have the free will to choose our way to reach the universal predetermined aim. Then what is the meaning of life?As explained that the universe and everything in this universe governed by the fundamental laws, it also means that we the human being are also not excluded. Humans are also ruled under the same laws so indirectly the destined aim of the almighty universe must also be the predestined aim of the human beings, as universe also run by the one of the law of trial and error which indirectly created the different structures and different existing living organisms on earth. But as everything is under some universal forces must be running for the same destination, gives proof to the existence of free will or the options to choose the path for the same destiny, which is stability and the universal neutrality.So this must be the real meaning of life “To choose our best path so that through us our universe can easily be heading towards the stability universal neutrality back.” has been labeled as: ['non-suicide']\n",

They want someone to clearly define and articulate in WORDS a sufficiently reasonable argument that satisfies the rational/logical faculties of the brain. The problem is, neither the meaning of life nor the reason for existence is rational in nature. It is fundamentally IRRATIONAL. This is why every highly rational/logical person (mathematician, scientist, physicist, etc) is completely stumped by such questions. One cannot explain something that is fundamentally irrational, rationally. That would be an absurd exercise. Imagine asking a mathematician to provide you with a math equation that explains the deep meaning behind a poem, or love, or empathy. That would be absolutely absurd! Even if they could string together a bunch of numbers and characters representing something as elusive as ‘love’ as an example, the end result would be totally meaningless as the act of translating an irrational experience into rational knowledge strips away all of its >>meaning<<, its richness, it’s depth and its essence. Therefore, one can never rationally explain something as irrational as the meaning of life, one can only FEEL it deep within the heart. So if you want to know the meaning of life, don’t look for theoretical information on the internet. Don’t try to come up with an intellectual “logically accurate” answer as there is none. Look deep within yourself; within your heart and you’ll get the answer you’re looking for.Stay Frosty ✌️ has been labeled as: ['non-suicide']\n",

      "Message The meaning of life is to live this life! In a very ancient family there was some musical organ, but people had completely forgotten how to play it. Generations came and people even forgot that it was a musical organ. It was gathering dust. It was a very big organ and it was taking up much space. One day the family decided to throw this nonsense. They said, ‘This is just a nuisance. Why should we keep it?’ They took it out; they threw it on the road. They had just reached home when a beggar started playing upon the organ. Time stopped. They simply turned. The whole traffic stopped, people came rushing from their houses; they forgot everything. For one hour the beggar was playing on it. It was so beautiful, so enchanting — they were just hypnotised. And when the music ended the family demanded their organ back. The beggar said, ‘It is not yours, because a musical instrument belongs to one who can play with it. There is no other ownership. It may have remained in your house for many centuries but it doesn’t belong to you. You are not worthy of it. I am the owner!’ And of course the whole crowd agreed with the beggar — that he was the owner — because what does one mean by ownership? A musical instrument belongs to one who can play with it. And that’s how it is: life belongs to those who can go deeper and deeper and deeper into it. has been labeled as: ['non-suicide']\n",

(Massive disappointment and depression ahead; proceed with caution) . . . Disregarding religion — if you are religious just stop reading now because you will not believe anything I am about to say. The universe is infinite but will only be infinite for a finite amount of time. That's a very difficult concept to grasp but eventually, galaxies will collide and then black holes will surround the vast universe everywhere. These black holes will eventually become the only thing that is left in the universe, no life or matter to exist anymore. These black holes will very slowly be dissipated into nothing through hawking radiation then becoming emptiness. When all the planets, stars, galaxies and then black holes are dissolved — the last proton will decay into oblivion and then -- Nothing. There will never be anything again. There's no stopping it. You cant avoid it. You see the reason why everyone on our planet is not depressed or killing themselves over this thought, although a good reason to — it is hardwired in our brains to survive. Climb that rock to get out of a hole, eat your childhood pet to not starve, find someone to multiply/increase odds of human survival, etc. So in the universal perspective, life has no meaning and everything you do. No matter how great or good — will be forgotten or erased forever eventually. In the terms of the natural evolutionary perspective, our meaning is to multiply and survive as long as we can.(Pillars of creation — real photograph) Also I do respect your belief of religion and I hope you respect mine about the universe.

It’s the simple math of our software: maximum pleasure at minimum effort. Just to put this in context, up until the 19th-20th century, people’s sense of meaning and purpose lay in simply surviving long enough to have a family and beget the next generation in line. People simply didn’t have any bigger questions about life, their egos were too small. On the whole, humanity’s ego was small and focused on the extraction of basic pleasure from the corporeal world around us. Then in the last 200 years or so, people’s search for meaning started going into various egoistic endeavors that fulfilled any number of desires for food, sex, a family, money, honor and celebrity status, political power and influence, even knowledge. This became quite extreme in the last two decades. For example, “I will have the best looking body, get the approval of people around me and have lots of sex. That’s the meaning of MY life.” Or, “I will find a cure for cancer at any cost, and at the expense of everything, everyone, and any other pleasure, and that will be the meaning of MY life”.And so on and so forth. I’m simplifying this in order to make a point. So as the ego grew, people’s search for meaning went into all those other directions. But all those pursuits happened at the expense of everyone and everything, either directly or indirectly. This was “allowed” and even “encouraged” by nature that was rewarding the bigger egoists. These kinds of pursuits provided short term “boosts” to humanity. For example, one man’s search for meaning through the pursuit of money and honor in the development of the best mobile phone, helped humanity become more connected and facilitated a host of other improvements to life. But the natural development of the ego has reached its necessary limit and people are not getting the same satisfaction from those same egoistic pursuits.

You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life. \" You have to know what makes you think you have absolutely no desire for life. A lot has been there. And overcame it and now they're at the point where most things are interesting. Having no desire for life can basically be translated to boredom. I have, for some time, pondered the question, “ What is the meaning of life? “ The simple answer which is not often heard is something I phrased into, “ Knowing what causes you to move. “ To know what makes you move means what makes you happy. Everyone has their own kind of happiness. You will always notice ( that despite thinking that you have no desire for life ) that there’s something that makes you happy. It’s not only one thing. There are a lot of things that make an individual happy. Make a list of those. Set a plan. Envision your own future. And remember those childhood or past moments where you felt so happy so you’ll have a clear idea on what to put on the lsit. What makes you move doesn’t necessarily only mean what makes you happy. It also means the contrary - what makes you sad. To know what makes you sad or uncomfortable will make you at least clear on what to do to avoid unsatisfactory situations. A simple meaning of life is knowing how to go through sadness or sufferings. There’s no such thing as ‘the meaning of life’ because it’s different for everybody. We’ll only have a general idea. I’d assume that you’re mostly bored and thinks that a lot of things are pointless or that there’s no point to everything that you’re doing. Life’s not all about ideas. Know what makes your body tick! Food, places, friends, sports, games, books, and too many things to mention we can specifically be interested in. Life has too many interesting things to be bored of. When I overcame the boredom problem which always struck me and had me confused, I always try to remember what usually caused it and it’s the brain feeling. You have to know how to control that feeling or find the algorithm of the cause of your own boredom. Once you realize that, it’ll be hard to be bored again. That’s what I did. I was bored for a year or two with some inconsistencies at least but now it’s completely different. I assure you that once you realize what ‘really’ causes your boredom, you’ll find a way out of it.

      "Message 1. Biological Perspective: The meaning of life, from a biological standpoint, is to ensure the continuation of one's genes through reproduction, contributing to the survival of the species. 2. Evolutionary Significance: Life's purpose can be seen through the lens of evolution, where the drive for survival and adaptation to the environment has led to the diversity of life forms we observe today. 3. Neurological Basis of Purpose: From a neurological standpoint, the human brain seeks purpose and meaning as a result of complex cognitive processes, including self-awareness and introspection. 4. Social Connection: Life gains additional meaning through social interactions and relationships. Humans, being social beings, find purpose in connection, cooperation, and shared experiences. 5. Cultural Constructs: Meaning is often shaped by cultural and societal influences. Beliefs, values, and traditions contribute to the individual and collective sense of purpose. 6. Intellectual Pursuits: The pursuit of knowledge, understanding, and intellectual growth can be considered a meaningful aspect of life, contributing to personal development and the advancement of society. 7. Contribution to the Common Good: Many find meaning in contributing to the welfare of others or making a positive impact on society, reflecting altruistic and communal values. 8. Personal Fulfillment:Life's meaning can be found in personal fulfillment and the pursuit of one's passions and goals, leading to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. 9. Psychological Well-being: Mental and emotional well-being contribute significantly to a meaningful life. Pursuing happiness, managing stress, and finding balance are integral aspects. 10. Legacy and Impact: Leaving a lasting impact, whether through relationships, accomplishments, or contributions, provides a sense of purpose that extends beyond one's lifetime. In summary, the meaning of life is a multifaceted concept encompassing biological, evolutionary, neurological, social, cultural, intellectual, altruistic, personal, and existential dimensions.

If we say: Life is to attain truth, then truth becomes the real purpose. But then what is the purpose of truth? If we say: Life is to seek God, then the question arises: “What is the purpose of God’? or of achieving God? or of realizing God?” In the end you have to drop the word purpose, finally...Access this answer and support the author as a Quora+ subscriberAccess all answers reserved by Hemanth for Quora+ subscribersAccess exclusive answers from thousands more participating creators in Quora+Browse ad‑free and support creatorsStart free trialLearn more has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message Most of us have no clue what we want to do with our lives. Even after we finish school, even after we get a job , even after we start making money, we fail to clearly define what we want from this life. It’s a struggle almost every adult goes through in life. “What do I want to do with my life” ?”What I’m passionate about”? Because there are so many answers to this question, it’s important to find that resonates us like , some say :— • The meaning of life is to be happy, • The meaning of life is to be at peace with yourself, • The meaning of life is developing feeling of contentment , • The meaning of life is serving humanity, • The meaning of life is to leave legacy, • The meaning of life is to love others, • The meaning of life is to create your own meaning, • The meaning of life is to make a positive difference, • The meaning of life is to have a variety of experiences, • The meaning of life is to find something important enough to justify sufferings . I mean , the concept for “meaning of life” is endless, people interpreting things as per their wisdom & thoughts , making spirituality a complex ,conflicting , chaotic & mysterious experience in itself. Part of the problem is the concept of “life meaning ”itself . The idea that we’re each born for some higher purpose & now it’s our cosmic mission to find it is the shitty logic used to justify things. People come to wonder about the meaning of life for a number of different reasons. May be they are inherently curious, or they have recently experienced a family tragedy, may be they’re questioning their faith or they are going through a depression or pressures in life & are looking for a renewed sense of meaning to escape the sufferings. So, when people say, “what should I do with life”? or “what’s the meaning of life” ? What they are actually asking is” What can I do with my time that’s important?” This is definitely a better question to ask. It’s far more manageable & it doesn’t have all the ridiculous baggage that the “ life meaning ” question demands. There’s no reason for us to be contemplating the cosmic significance of our life while sitting on a couch all day eating potatoes. Rather we should get off our ass & discover what feels important to us & go for it.Basically discovering meaning in our lives should be something that’s fun & interesting & not a chore. Truth is , we exist on this planet for some determined period of time & we do things during the time available to us .Some of these are important & Some are not. The important things that we do gives our lives meaning & happiness while the unimportant ones just kill time. Everything sucks, some of the time.Everything involves some sort of struggle & sacrifice . There’s is no free lunch on earth. Nothing is goody- goody all the time. It’s our ability to handle our struggles, the rough patches of our life, our tolerance threshold that determines the person that we become ultimately. Suppose we want to become a brilliant doctor or a lawyer or a tech entrepreneur or a professional artist but we can’t handle failure, embarrassment,if we can’t stand 90 hrs work week then definitely we’re not going to make it far. What unpleasant experiences in life we are capable of handling, make us what we become in future. If you avoid anything that embarrass you, then you are done away with instantly. It all comes back to vulnerability. Living a life avoiding embarrassment is akin to living a life with your head in the sand . Great things are , by their very nature, unique & unconventional. To achieve them , we must go against the herd mentality. And to do that is scary but do it . Find a problem you care about & start solving it. What most people fail to understand is that the passion is the result of action, not the cause of it. Discovering what you are passionate about in life & what matters to you is a trial & error process. We exactly don’t know how it feels to do the activity until we actually do the activity. Most of us don’t like thinking about death.It freaks us out. But thinking about our own death surprisingly has a lot of practical advantages. One of those is it forces us to zero in on what’s actually important in our lives & what’s just frivolous & distracting. Ultimately death only gives us perspective on the value of our life. Because it’s only by imagining our non-existence that we can get a sense of what’s most important about our existence & hence meaning of our life. When people have no sense of direction , no meaning in life , it’s because they have not identified their goals in life. And when we don’t know the values of our lives,we live with the priorities of others , instead of our own . Take it Easy! Just Chill. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

Three options.We were created by some powerful being to CHOOSE to worship said being of our own free will.We are a product of evolution, and the point of our life is nothing more than to propagate our species.EDIT (added in afterthought) We could have been created by some Alien species far more developed than we are (but someone we have imagined ourselves acting like in the far future in our popular fiction), so... being created without the requirement for worship is possible... if specific.  Prometheus (2012) did a nice job with this.  But if this were possible, then there would be distinct answers.  Like... our meaning of life was that we were supposed to be cattle or \"feed\" for some predator species... or we were an experiment long since abandoned... or we are only at a middle stage of a pre-planned evolution, where our skin model under thousands of years of exposure to a yellow sun develops the correct radiation protection for stable Faster-Than-Light travel... and the intelligence to question our place in the universe is a byproduct of the process of becoming a being able to use these ships that multiple different species have been using to fly about the stars for billions of years.That's it.  Those are your choices.  I'm sure plenty of people will want to argue that there are more options than these... but there really aren't. If you believe in the existence of a Creator, it created us to worship it.  That is our purpose.  That's it.  Ok... worship it, and create little baby worshippers.  So, belief in God, meaning of life is we were created to worship said God. If you don't believe in a creator... then our purpose is to ensure that the species continues.  That means that everything other than propagation is secondary. So.  Created to worship, or evolved to perpetuate.  You choose. has been labeled as: ['non-suicide']\n",

      "Message What is the meaning of life? When I was 17, I also wanted to know the answer to “What is the meaning of life”. So I contemplated what I had read and heard about God, decided He does exist, and that meaning and answers were held in Him, somehow. It seemed logical to me that He existed. But, I had never prayed except mouthing our little grace at family dinner and saying in rote the Lord’s Prayer at school every morning with the other children during grade school opening time. (This was a long time ago when prayer was still part of public school.) I had no idea what I was saying in these prayers, and certainly had never thought about it. It was just something we had all been taught to do, like memorizing the facts and figures of the rest of learning. Back to me being seventeen: So one night after deciding God existed, I decided to test Him and actually talk to Him, in fact, to demand that He help me. Silently, I thought to Him, “I’m going to pray out loud over and over, ‘God help me!’ and won’t stop until you actually do”. I was thinking to Him, ‘You’ll be really embarrassed if you don’t help me, because I’ll be known as the girl who keeps asking you for help everywhere I go, public and private, but that You evidently don’t care and are not really helpful at all. I’ll be a nuisance to everyone, especially to You!” I figured that would scare Him into answering me so He could save his reputation. (I was never that insolent with my parents.) So that night, I only got one “God help me” out of my mouth, and suddenly He was there with me. I was overwhelmed and automatically flipped over from lying on my back on to flat on my face, still and silent while listening to Him as He talked. When He stopped talking, I begged Him stay and tell me more, but He was done. But I accepted that because then I had the proof and the reassurances I wanted, and never again doubted His existence or that He is a personal God. One of the things He told me that night was to start reading the Bible. So that is the basis of what I am now sharing with you. I believe the Holy Bible is indeed the “Word of God”, and in it is all truth. From that comes the following information. When it comes to the meaning of life, everyone has an opinion and some are more valid than others. The great teacher of long ago was Jesus Christ Son of God, who said, “I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE”. HE is the meaning of life! Did you see that? Did you hear it in your soul? Jesus is the WAY we should be going. Jesus is the TRUTH we should be living. Jesus is the LIFE that must also be our own life. Following that statement, He said, “No person comes to the Father (God) except through Me, meaning going through Jesus Himself. He is the doorway to God. The first time God spoke to Moses is told in the Old Testament. Moses asked Him, “Who shall I say you are?” God answered by saying, “I AM that I AM”. Okay then, so who is this great I AM? He seems to our natural minds to think highly of himself. But actually His nature is demonstrated by his Son Jesus in the New Testament, and that nature is love and humility. Many believe that Jesus and God are One and the same. If that is so, and for the sake of this answer let’s assume it is true, then we must obviously conclude that GOD IS the way, the truth, and the life. If God is life, then without God there is no life. This kind of life means not only physical life, but also spiritual life. That is what that radical statement capitalized above just said. “I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE”. Without God, we are not living as human beings created in the likeness of God, but are simply evolved animals as is taught in most schools in the U.S., and therefore operating on an animal level but with higher intelligence. How depressing that must be for young people to think. How base and worthless some must feel. Rather, you are God’s creation and precious in His sight! You could also say “Meaning of Life” is the ‘Reason’ for life. In summary: What is the meaning of life? The meaning of life is that God is love, so to get that kind of Life, the really alive Life, God must be in us and we must be in Him. That is life. That is the Reason for Life. Wise men still seek Him but fools deny Him. And what does He say? “COME and ask Me to live in you.” He also says, “You who are tired and carrying a heavy burden on your shoulders, come to Me and I will give you rest. I will carry you through this life.” This is so that you can run lightly with joy and meaning. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message The meaning of life is a profound and philosophical question that has been pondered by humans for centuries. It is a topic that has no single, definitive answer and is often subject to personal beliefs, cultural perspectives, and philosophical interpretations. Different individuals, religions, and philosophical schools of thought offer their insights into the purpose and meaning of life. Here are some perspectives: 1. Religious Beliefs: Many religions propose that the meaning of life is to fulfill a divine purpose or to seek spiritual enlightenment. This could involve serving a higher power, following moral principles, or attaining a state of eternal bliss or salvation. 2. Existentialist Perspective: Existentialist thinkers, such as Jean-Paul Sartre, argue that life has no inherent or predetermined meaning. Instead, they believe that individuals must create meaning through personal choices and actions. 3. Pursuit of Happiness and Fulfillment: Some people believe that the meaning of life lies in seeking happiness, joy, and fulfillment. This could involve personal growth, meaningful relationships, and pursuing one's passions and dreams. 4. Contribution and Service: For others, the purpose of life is to make a positive impact on the world and to help others. This could involve acts of kindness, charitable work, or contributing to society in meaningful ways. 5. Understanding Reality and Truth: Philosophers and seekers of truth may believe that the meaning of life lies in gaining a deeper understanding of reality, existence, and the nature of consciousness. 6. Evolution and Survival: From a biological perspective, the meaning of life can be seen as the continuation of the species through survival and reproduction.Ultimately, the meaning of life is a deeply personal and subjective question. It is up to each individual to explore, question, and contemplate their purpose and what gives their life meaning. People often find meaning in different aspects of life, including relationships, personal achievements, contributions to society, and connections to the natural world. It is a journey of self-discovery and reflection that evolves throughout one's life. I hope this helps! :) Profile Link: Sandeep Sagar Gummalla has been labeled as: ['non-suicide']\n",

Watching generations of animals come and go, seasons change, and the world evolve around me has provided me with a unique perspective on the purpose and significance of existence. Through my years of steadfast endurance, I have learned that finding meaning in life requires more than just simple existence; it demands introspection, contemplation, and above all, a deep understanding of one's roots. And so, it is with great humility that I share my story with you, in the hopes that it may guide you on your own journey to find the meaning of life.The Deep Wisdom of a Tree: Pondering the Meaning of Life As I ponder the passage of time, I'm left to consider the fundamental query of existence: what is the significance of life? It's an inquiry that has vexed scholars and philosophers for generations, yet no decisive solution has emerged. However, as a tree, I possess the rare gifts of time and perspective that humans seldom possess. Across my lengthy existence, I've witnessed numerous cycles of life and death, ultimately arriving at my own conclusions regarding what confers meaning and purpose upon life. My foremost belief is that meaning and purpose can't be found in solitude. Humans, like all living things, form part of a larger interdependent system. By acknowledging and valuing the interconnectedness of all things, we can begin to locate our place in the world. Just as the branches of a tree are linked and reliant on one another, so too are humans tied to the planet, to one another, and to all life forms. However, that is not to say that the significance of life is exclusively a matter of interdependence. Humans have a unique capacity for consciousness and self-awareness. It's through developing one's self that we can begin to find our own sense of purpose. One can pursue various avenues to achieve this, from creative and intellectual endeavors to serving others or engaging in spiritual practices. Whatever form it takes, the critical factor is to identify something that elicits joy, satisfaction, and a sense of connection to the world. Of course, this is easier said than done. Life is replete with obstacles and setbacks, and it's all too common to become disheartened. However, this is where the wisdom of the tree can be especially valuable. As a tree, I have withstood countless tempests and endured extended periods of drought and heat. But through it all, I have remained firmly anchored, knowing that each season brings its own beauty and purpose. This, in my estimation, is the authentic essence of life: to remain grounded in our purpose and connection, even in the face of adversity. Whether buffeted by the winds of change or parched by the heat of conflict, we must remain steadfast in our commitment to finding meaning and purpose in our lives. Ultimately, the significance of life can't be defined or distilled into a simplistic formula. It's a voyage of discovery, of searching out those things that fill us with joy, satisfaction, and a sense of connection to the world. But, as a tree, I've learned that this journey is most fruitful when it's anchored in a profound sense of interconnectedness and rootedness. May we all discover our path to this profound wisdom and purpose. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

We Humans are the most successful Species on earth and our minds are the wonder of evolution. Centuries old philosophy on dharma ; literatures ;decades old traditions and strict laws ;advices us and guides us such that we will grow old without guilt and shame and regret and only with good contentment and satisfaction of our time spent living . I questioned the meaning of life ,in different points of view ; one of a hard-working married neurologist who is about to die of cancer .His short fate motivates him to write a book describing his early life, his passion for neurology, his hardships and ultimately his desire to happily live with his newborn and his wife .In the point of view of a teenager who is driven to succeed but never gives up their love.In the point of view of an old man who has done his deeds and holds no regrets.In all points of view of people i have heared of or seen , I see everyone backing away from guilt , Shame , regret, unhappiness, worry , misfortune , accidents and mistakes and wishes to attain hapiness, peace of mind ,pride , satisfaction, relief and shanti( calmness)I don't consider life meaningless. But rather I consider success without the satisfaction of it as meaningless , I consider rich possessions possessed with anxiety of theft or loss meaningless , I consider lifelong but unhappy relationships meaningless, I consider the forced smile we just maintain for photographs meaningless .Life I consider is meaningful as long as we ,the ones who live it , are happy for the journey . Life I consider is fulfilling when I feel actually proud for my accomplishments . Life I consider is complete when I hold no regret ,no anger , no revenge and no unfulfilled desires , when I breath out my last breath .P.S : actually I got inspired to write this answer by seeing a comment on an answer . I ll share that answer and that comment here . has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

Life itself is a Meaning, Living itself is a 'Definition' living itself defines your life.

But two paths are in front of you; One is Living for a 'Purpose' or living for a 'sake' .Life is not a problem to be solved, its Mystery to be lived. Don’t try to figure it out - OshoEvery legend on this planet had a title called a 'Purpose'; purpose generates a energy,energy transforms to a change, a change makes a living better.Jnanapeeta An Awardee Girish Karnad beautifully Says “You can walk for a mile in a Darkness, But you cant keep a step without a Dream”.Just imagine if all trees stop exhaling Oxygen, If Sun Stops illuminating, Water Stops flowing, wind stop breezing by all these earth might have turned to inhabitable. “The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.” - Dostovesky Why only few people become successful,why only few people are living happily? why the rest of world is in havoc inspite of having same blood and flesh, No it not matters what matters is 'Purpose'. Purpose may be anything ; it might be love, compassion, creativity, innovation etc..Without love we would have not witnessed mother Theresa, without creativity we could have missed Einstein. Gandhi, Lincoln, Luther King etc we got these wonderful breeds only by seed called 'Purpose' they were a Purpose Driven. They made this planet better .“You were put on this earth to achieve your greatest self, to live out your purpose, and to do it courageously.” - Steve Maraboli Every best thing on the Planet came from a 'Purpose' not of a 'Sake' . If you find purpose you discovered your life!!:) Spread happiness!!☺ S^_^ [1] Image sourceFootnotes[1] Image on weebly.com has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",
