      "Message You are here for the obvious reason that was right in front of you the whole time that you may or may not want to accept. The reason why you are here is because your parents had sex and reproduced. You are now the child of your parents and it has been this way for thousands of years. Your life span is between 0 to 90 years on average. It shall not be wasted through deep philosophical questions, depression, not accepting the truth of existence, and so forth. Your life should be spent by simply enjoying life itself. Take this advice from a deep thinking highly intelligent programmer and graphic designer. I spent hours in my room alone (not everyday, but often) reading about consciousness, neuroscience, Buddhism, Christianity, and other fields of study that are related to existence in the hopes that I would find some pretty solid evidence of an afterlife. I am going to die anyway at one point wether if I spend hours in my room thinking of death and trying to find evidence for an afterlife or if I spend that time having fun with friends and family instead. After realizing that, I quit thinking so deep and I quit worrying so much about it and instead just simply started living my life to the fullest again. As for the meaning of life, it is completely subjective. Man makes his own meaning. However, there is no objective meaning of life. Here are some rules to follow in order to live a meaningful and enjoyable life.Don’t take it for granted: Out of nowhere, you came out of the whom and you now exist. You have a limited time offer of existence so make the most of it.Don’t live your life based on the opinions of others: Humans are all the same. They are born, they live, and they die. Don't worry about what other people think. Their time is limited just like yours. Live your life the way you want to live it.Only worry and care about those who worry and care about you: Once again, your time is limited. Spend your time with people who are worth spending time with.Find a job you enjoy: Once again, your time is limited. Enjoy your your job or try and find a new job if you don't like your job. Time is money and life is time and money. Spend it wisely.Meet someone new everyday: Talk to anybody. Overtime, you will build memories of talking to all kinds of people and remembering the stories they have told you. You can learn a lot from anybody that you talk to.Have a great love and sex life with someone you care about.Enjoy the little things.Accept that you will die one day: The longer you can't accept death, the more you are already dead. The more you accept death, the more time you will spend being alive and living life.Go with the flow: Go where life takes you and expect nothing good or bad. Life is like a box of chocolates you know.Don’t dwell on the past: The way you think of things determines your future. Focus on the present and accept your past to enjoy your future. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message Originally Answered: Rahul Nayak's answer to What is the purpose of life?This is a question I believe a lot of people, who think to live or who avoid living by thinking, have wasted a lot of time on. The reason I believe this question is so popular is because it leads to a perpetual chain of reasons and hence is a perfect instrument to kill time. It works like an addiction when you have a lot of time to kill and lot of things to run away from. I think I have both. So I am highly tempted to write an answer with full knowledge of the fact that it is going to be an exercise in vain. Evolutionary perspectiveIf you think from an evolutionary point of view, the answer is simple. The purpose of life is to create more life. All living beings live to reproduce so that the evolution can continue churning its wheel creating diversity and complexity. Even though this answer may be the simplest and most convincing of all, it is too mundane for human intellect. While this purpose fits really well for most of the life forms, It doesn't really explain the existence of beings who can ask this question and kill time. Because even if they find the answer, they don't stand a chance to reproduce more, in fact they might even be punished by females of their species for being useless for all practical purposes. Philosophical perspective Plato put forth the meaning of life in achieving highest form of knowledge. And the highest form of knowledge according to him is the idea of “Good”. According to Aristotle (one of the students of Pluto)What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.Now that is confusing. It says that the purpose of life is happiness but the meaning of happiness is not clear. That is like answering a question with another question. but then what else can we expect from philosophers. Religious perspective When we talk about religious perspective of purpose of life, more or less we talk about purpose of human life (I don't know if animals have their own religions.. so can't comment) Hinduism: I being a Hindu can comment on Hindu perspective of purpose of life better than other religion. Although Hinduism itself has a multitude of schools of thoughts, so nothing qualifies as the final word. According to one of the well accepted schools, the purpose of life is four fold: Dharma, Artha, Kaam, Moksha. None of these four words have an exact parallel in english. Loosely speaking, Dharma means duty. Duty with respect to God (if you believe in one), Parents, Fellow human beings and all life forms. Artha means pursuit of wealth, because being poor suck for sure. Kaam signifies pleasure. Last but the toughest, Moksha, means the enlightenment. The attainment of ultimate knowledge (Brahm Gyaan) to be liberated from the cycle of life and death and become one with the parmatma (the primary soul of the universe). While each of these four facets are complete by themselves, together they form the ultimate purpose of life. Buddhism: I think Buddhists have the best word for the purpose of life… to attain Nirvana (It is pronounced without the ‘a’ at the end). Nirvana is a concept very hard to explain in any language. Although I believe it is close to the word “Moksha”. Nirvana is achieved by conquering one's own desires and achieving ultimate understanding of samsara (the universe, the cycle of birth and death and the materialistic reality and the suffering). I do not have a good understanding of the Abrahamic religions. Ill appreciate comments to add other religions perspective as well. But I believe all the religions point to the purpose of life as purification of heart and soul in some manner. Ridding oneself from wrong deeds and accumulating good deeds as one goes along living life. Personal perspective All that the sages and the philosophers have to say, more often than not, is not easy to understand by ordinary people like me. So I have my own ideas of the purpose of life (specifically my life) An idea: Everyone is born unique and given how complicated a life form is, it is practically impossible that the exact you will ever exist again in this universe. Being so unique, everyone has at least one unique idea that will die forever if it is not put out into the universe. The purpose of life, probably is to put this one idea out and implement it. May be it is a delicious chicken curry, may be it is a song, a poem, it may be a piece of code, a design of furniture… it can be anything at all.Evolution: Nature, by the virtue of its mechanisms, points us to a purpose. The propensity of nature is the evolve. So our duty as a part of nature is to evolve. To achieve scientific advancements and to break out of our home planet in order to explore the universe. Any small step taken by an individual in that direction is a fulfilling purpose in itself. Anyone can improve upon one’s area of interest and redefine the state of art and every such redefinition is a baby step in our evolution. Love: We are all born with a set of people granted to us. And we gather more as we go along living life. If we are lucky, we find that one person for whom we feel a very special kind of love. All These people care for us. They feel happy with us and they feel sad in our sadness. They provide us with another purpose of life. The purpose of being there for them. Live with them, enjoy with them, take care of them, and be around them when they die. Happiness: If you think about it, the perpetual chain of metaphysical reasons to find the purpose of life does not lead anyone anywhere. So why not understand its futility and rather concentrate on something practical. Why not concentrate on one’s own happiness. While it is hard to define happiness as a general idea, it is easy to define what it is not. Pleasure should not be misunderstood as happiness because pleasure is sensory and ephemeral. Anything, the effect of which does not last for a time of the order of one’s life (Life is generally measured in years) can be opted out. Happiness comes out of deep contentment with oneself. Being comfortable in one’s own skin. One needs to make sure to do the “Right thing” rather than the easy thing, in order to be content with oneself. When we are in our full mental health we rarely ask this question. We asks this when life seems nebulous and defence mechanisms do not work any more, we ask this when our belief system shakes or breaks down and we need a purpose upon which we can built a new one. In these times, the purpose of life can be the most elusive idea. I have always been in the need of a simple answer that I can use in such times. I believe we as humans are slave to our perceptions. And any purpose that we convince ourselves as a worthy one is as good as any other. Metaphysics and Philosophy may be good topics to wonder about, Though there is a good possibility that there actually is no higher purpose of life than just to live happily. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

I know the meaning of life. Of course, I didn’t come up with it on my own. Many have answered this question before me. What do they have to say? Here are three of my favorites.Victor Frankl was a world-renowned neurologist and psychiatrist, as well as a philosopher in his own right. Frankl survived the Holocaust: he saw the absolute extremes of human cruelty. He was swallowed by evil incarnate, and he survived to tell the tale. In his book, Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl answers the question by flipping it on its head:Ultimately, man should should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.But he goes further. Frankl outlines three specific things that give life meaning:…the meaning of life always changes, but it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: 1. By creating a work or doing a deed; 2. By experiencing something or encountering someone; 3. By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.For Frankl, the meaning of life isn’t prescribed. It’s created. Each person’s life has its own unique, context-specific meaning. We may give meaning to our lives by creating, by experiencing, and by choosing our response to a situation, but it is we who must give that meaning.The existentialist thinker Jean-Paul Sartre took a similar tactic. For Sartre, there is no objective, all-encompassing meaning of life. There is no rubric. In other words:Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.But this doesn’t mean life is meaningless. In fact, in this void of objective meaning, every action becomes meaningful. In Sartre’s eyes, our actions create a meaning to life, and that meaning is whatever those actions define it to be. But my favorite answer is a lot less heady. Don’t get me wrong, I love the existentialists. I think they got at something beautiful. But when I answer the question “what is the meaning of life,” this is what I say:…the universe in general and playing in particular are, in a special sense,\"meaningless\": that is, they do not - like words and symbols - signify or point to something beyond themselves.This comes from the British philosopher Alan Watts, and I love it because it reveals the silliness of the question.Watts took much of his philosophy from Eastern wisdom traditions like Hinduism and Buddhism. For him, the entire effort to answer the meaning of life in words is ridiculous. Here he is again:People get all fouled up because they want the world to have meaning as if it were words...As if you had a meaning, as if you were a mere word, as if you were something that could be looked up in a dictionary. You are meaning.Viewed from this angle, the only sensible answer for the meaning of life is to recognize that it’s a nonsensical question. Trying to parse out a “meaning,” trying to find the moral of the story, is a fool’s errand. See how he finishes the quote above:[Life is] in a special sense,\"meaningless\": that is, [it does] not - like words and symbols - signify or point to something beyond [itself], just as a Mozart sonata conveys no moral or social message and does not try to suggest the sounds of wind, thunder, or birdsong.Trying to find the meaning of life with words is like trying to sing a song by describing it. You’re missing the point. If you want to know the meaning of life, sit for a while on an old wooden bridge above a calm stream in late autumn. Feel the cool breeze glide across your skin. Listen to the sounds of the forest, quietly singing to itself in birdsong. See how the light goes yellow, red, blue, purple as the sun dips down below the horizon. In this life, this is all the meaning you will ever get. But it is all the meaning that you could ever, ever need. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message What is the meaning of life? When I was 17, I also wanted to know the answer to “What is the meaning of life”. So I contemplated what I had read and heard about God, decided He does exist, and that meaning and answers were held in Him, somehow. It seemed logical to me that He existed. But, I had never prayed except mouthing our little grace at family dinner and saying in rote the Lord’s Prayer at school every morning with the other children during grade school opening time. (This was a long time ago when prayer was still part of public school.) I had no idea what I was saying in these prayers, and certainly had never thought about it. It was just something we had all been taught to do, like memorizing the facts and figures of the rest of learning. Back to me being seventeen: So one night after deciding God existed, I decided to test Him and actually talk to Him, in fact, to demand that He help me. Silently, I thought to Him, “I’m going to pray out loud over and over, ‘God help me!’ and won’t stop until you actually do”. I was thinking to Him, ‘You’ll be really embarrassed if you don’t help me, because I’ll be known as the girl who keeps asking you for help everywhere I go, public and private, but that You evidently don’t care and are not really helpful at all. I’ll be a nuisance to everyone, especially to You!” I figured that would scare Him into answering me so He could save his reputation. (I was never that insolent with my parents.) So that night, I only got one “God help me” out of my mouth, and suddenly He was there with me. I was overwhelmed and automatically flipped over from lying on my back on to flat on my face, still and silent while listening to Him as He talked. When He stopped talking, I begged Him stay and tell me more, but He was done. But I accepted that because then I had the proof and the reassurances I wanted, and never again doubted His existence or that He is a personal God. One of the things He told me that night was to start reading the Bible. So that is the basis of what I am now sharing with you. I believe the Holy Bible is indeed the “Word of God”, and in it is all truth. From that comes the following information. When it comes to the meaning of life, everyone has an opinion and some are more valid than others. The great teacher of long ago was Jesus Christ Son of God, who said, “I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE”. HE is the meaning of life! Did you see that? Did you hear it in your soul? Jesus is the WAY we should be going. Jesus is the TRUTH we should be living. Jesus is the LIFE that must also be our own life. Following that statement, He said, “No person comes to the Father (God) except through Me, meaning going through Jesus Himself. He is the doorway to God. The first time God spoke to Moses is told in the Old Testament. Moses asked Him, “Who shall I say you are?” God answered by saying, “I AM that I AM”. Okay then, so who is this great I AM? He seems to our natural minds to think highly of himself. But actually His nature is demonstrated by his Son Jesus in the New Testament, and that nature is love and humility. Many believe that Jesus and God are One and the same. If that is so, and for the sake of this answer let’s assume it is true, then we must obviously conclude that GOD IS the way, the truth, and the life. If God is life, then without God there is no life. This kind of life means not only physical life, but also spiritual life. That is what that radical statement capitalized above just said. “I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE”. Without God, we are not living as human beings created in the likeness of God, but are simply evolved animals as is taught in most schools in the U.S., and therefore operating on an animal level but with higher intelligence. How depressing that must be for young people to think. How base and worthless some must feel. Rather, you are God’s creation and precious in His sight! You could also say “Meaning of Life” is the ‘Reason’ for life. In summary: What is the meaning of life? The meaning of life is that God is love, so to get that kind of Life, the really alive Life, God must be in us and we must be in Him. That is life. That is the Reason for Life. Wise men still seek Him but fools deny Him. And what does He say? “COME and ask Me to live in you.” He also says, “You who are tired and carrying a heavy burden on your shoulders, come to Me and I will give you rest. I will carry you through this life.” This is so that you can run lightly with joy and meaning. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

Here’s a link to Total Adblock, if you’re interested.2. Overspending when online shopping. You might be surprised how often you’re overpaying on Amazon and elsewhere. Big stores like Amazon know that no one has time to price shop through dozens of sites, so there's often no incentive for them to offer bargain prices. I typically hate browser extensions with a fiery passion, but if you don’t have Capital One Shopping installed yet, do yourself a favor and grab it. When you shop online (on Amazon or elsewhere) it will:Auto-apply coupon codes for you to save you moneyCompare prices from other sellers to make sure you’re not missing out on a better dealIt’s saved me a ton of money more than once.

You’ll likely save yourself a bunch of money. Here’s a link to Coverage. 4. Not dealing with credit card debt. Debt can make you feel hopeless—even if you’re responsible about making payments on time, the interest sometimes prevents you from paying off the debt. But, believe it or not, plenty of companies (Accredited Debt Relief, for example) are willing to help you pay off your debt. Here’s how it typically works:You typically need $20k+ in overall debt.A company like Accredited Debt Relief (there are plenty of others, too) negotiates with your credit card companies, banks etc. to try and reduce your debt.If possible, they’ll consolidate all of your different sources of debt so you only have to make one monthly payment to one place.A lot of times you’ll end up paying significantly less than you owe. Here’s an example from Accredited’s site:E.g. he was $80k in debt, but only ended up paying $50kish. If things go well, you could be debt-free in 24-48 months or so. Here’s a calculator you can use to get a savings estimate, if you’re interested. 5. Not getting a financial advisor. 99% of people don’t have one, and it’s typically a huge mistake. Sure, you can manage things on your own if you want to, but most people don’t have the time to actually do things right. There are huge benefits to having somebody pay attention to your money all the time.People with financial advisors tend to beat the market by ~3%/year (according to a 2019 Vanguard Study). That can make a huge difference over time.But more important: a good advisor will handle ALL of the annoying retirement stuff & bizarro tax implications you would have never thought of.If you don’t know a financial advisor personally, use a comparison site (like WiserAdvisor) and find somebody near you that has good reviews. Or if you want something easier, here’s a quiz you can fill out that will find an advisor/planner based on your reqs. 6. Not investing in real estate (start with as little as $20). It’s no secret that millionaires and billionaires love investing in real estate, but for the rest of us, buying property has been prohibitively expensive (if not impossible, for some). Times have changed. There are a few amazing real estate startups that allow you to buy shares of rental homes for as little as $20/share (Ark7 is one of our favorites). They take care of the property management and collect rent checks for you. Then, on the 3rd of the following month, your share of the property’s profit is distributed to your account. It’s an interesting way to build yourself a little rental home empire (without spending like a magnate). If you’re interested, take a look at Ark7’s properties here. 7. Being a paid game tester ($20/day). Are you familiar with Freecash at all? It’s basically an app that will pay you to test new games. It’s easy to get started: Download the app here, choose a game from the ‘Earn Page’, complete the offer (takes 5-10 minutes tops), then get paid and cash out via Apple Pay, gift cards, etc. Whenever you play a free phone game, you generate ad money for the game developer.

      "Message Whenever I went through Hell, I figured out the meaning of life.When I was jobless : I was a fresher when I went to do my MBA from IIM-I; like 99% of the MBA aspirants, there was only one goal - to get the highest paying job. Miraculously I got one! But it was in an African country, I came running back within 2 months of joining & then the unemployment phase begin. I went through Hell, searching for jobs, thinking I f*cked up my one & only campus placement, crazily applied for just any job, did one low-level (B.Com) job for 3 months, thinking I ended my career before it even started. But I did not give up! I kept giving interviews, faced rejections but pushed through & finally under 2–3 months I got the job I deserved. After all of this, I realised, there was no point of putting unnecessary pressure on myself for campus placements when life can get royally f*cked anytime without any warning.When I was obese : While I was preparing for CAT, I had a strict schedule, 9am–5pm engineering college, CAT coaching 6pm–8pm, some dinner & TV till 9pm and then self-study till midnight. Despite all of this, morning 6am-8am slot was booked for physical fitness, I went bonkers with 6km running, pilates, pushups and what not. The life at IIM-I messed it all up, no eating/sleeping/exercising schedule; I entered at 42kg and graduated with 70kg. I was looking very unhealthy on the outside and very low in confidence on the inside. Decided to lose the extra fat, walked 14,000 steps everyday, my feet used to hurt like hell, I used to cry, but I pushed through and after 2 f*cking years lost zero (0) weight. Just when I was on the verge of giving up, I realised, I had no other option but to keep following healthy practices (with or without any results) & just leave it on time.When I had troubles in my marriage : Since this is personal let’s just keep it short. As a person who truly believes in “live & let others live”, I suddenly found myself surrounded with vicious women who had no other pastime than saying hurtful words and manipulating others. Obviously like all the men, my spouse was either ignorant about/ tried to ignore this politics within the family which was emotionally affecting me. Again, I was going through hell as I was trying to understand how the person who truly cared about me before marriage suddenly doesn’t give a damn about basic things like my respect & health (read sanity). I realised, I can neither stop nor distance myself from it for eternity & also why someone else has that kind of power over me that they can just throw me into depression any day? Instead, I’ve learnt to take my own stand now, I've stopped giving into manipulations and more importantly I’ve learnt to shift my focus on productive things rather than pointless bickering.So basically, for me, the meaning of life per se is NOTHING. We give it meaning by the way we live it, by :Neither taking too much pressure nor leaving everything on God (fate)Realising that we can never give up even if we desperately want toTaking our power back and leading our mind towards meaningful thingsCheers, AK has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message Technically we are nothing, absolutely nothing but genetic material. Thats it. Like, we think we are special somehow because of our brains and opposable thumbs and language, but we really aren’t. All life on the Planet Earth is pretty much the equivalent of mold. If you combine water and light, you’ll eventually have life and its unfortunate to think about, but we have no greater purpose. Saying our only purpose is to have babies and continue the species isn’t entirely wrong, but in truth its not even that. We are just bundles of cells that decided to work together in order to reproduce more efficiently. We reproduce, we get old, we die. Cycle continues ad-infinitum until the Human Race is wiped out or replaced, which will happen eventually. We are not the center of the universe, we don’t matter, we are, as previously mentioned, the same thing as mold. We are insignificant and it doesn’t really matter whether we expand or not, but in all honesty we are more so a virus. What is right, truly right? Is Life right? Why? Whats special about Life? Nothing, thats it. The Universe doesn’t care whether we exist or not, it doesn’t care if we are happy or fulfilled or have a purpose. We are creatures of instinct, creatures that try to be happy but it doesn’t matter because we just die. Do we think of how an ant feels before we squash it? So when we die, it doesn’t matter. Birth, death, it doesn’t matter. We all search for food, and then we seek to procreate, and then we die off and are replaced by our descendants. Our experiences don’t matter. Even this conversation doesn’t matter, because one day we will all be gone and this will be totally forgotten as though it doesn’t exist. Life isn’t about pain or suffering or anything. Its just life, its just existence, fooling ourselves with grandiose is irrelevant. We will all live to see someone we love die, and then we will witness the deaths of everyone around us and its completely natural.

Remember, the famous people wouldn’t exist if everybody was known, and whoever said they did anything without the help of people like you or me. Surely George Washington did not win the Revolutionary War alone. Even if it is not your face in the limelight, why be ashamed? Is not a deed greater in secret than in public? So be it that history does not remember you, because somebody, somewhere, will. What is the meaning of life? The meaning of life. Ahh, an age old question. Socrates, Plato, the great philosophers came, and they were found wanting. Their answers are amazing, incredible, and quite frankly awesome (as in inspiring great awe). Are they the correct answers? I don’t know, and I’m sure plenty others would disagree, both with me and them. Well, you’re asking me, so you get my answer. Life is worthless. Life has no meaning, it is nothing. It, is an empty slate. Life has no meaning because meaning should not be in its hands. Perhaps a better term would be, life is the breathe that animates what gives meaning. On its own, life is just a vegetative state. But clearly, we aren’t all vegetables. No, the meaning in life, is us. We create meaning, we make the world something, we make it mean something. We are the why to the what. It is only right, as life is the what, and we, as living creatures are the why. Why do people do things? Either for themselves, or for something else. Life on its own has no value, but the things in it? Yeah, those things are the most important reason why life has value. They give us cause, they give us reason. A mother saves her child not because of life but because of the child. A boy mourns his dog not because it is no longer alive, but because without it, his life loses a glimmer of meaning. A person holds on to life because they want to retain all the things in it. We, as the Bible would say, are the light of the world. Not solely because we ought to spread a religion, but because we give meaning. We produce laughter, love and many other emotions. We give it meaning. We are meaning. Our lives are little pinpricks of fire that light up the abyssal void. Sometimes, there is pain. That pain too, can define us. We can use it for many different reasons, but in the end, you know what? It makes us human. And you know? It is good, it is very good. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

As we age, we encounter various experiences that shape who we are today. However, in my case, everything appears to be moving in the opposite direction. It's as if karma is operating in reverse – the more good I do for others, the worse things get for me. Imagination is my only source of happiness because in real life I'm just dead dead dead. This cycle of pain, trauma, trust issues, and insecurity feels never-ending.

Monty Python covered it fairly well. What is the meaning of life to you? It depends. Upon you. We tend to think of life in terms of everyone else’s lives. We tend to try to put the “meaning of life” into a kind of theme that fits all. But we can’t do that for anyone else. We can only do it for ourselves. The research shows that we choose our lives. By research I mean the thousands of cases reported by Dr. Helen Wambach and Michael Newton. Both psychologists used hypnosis over a vast amount of time and people to get uniform, consistent answers about why we choose to incarnate. I’ve filmed 45 people claiming to remember why and how they chose to incarnate. Why they chose this lifetime, why they chose this planet. They claim “this isn’t the only game in town.” That we choose this planet for a variety of reasons, but we can choose lifeforms elsewhere on different planets. I would have initially thought those answers were crazy, but when thousands of people claim the same thing which is outside their own conscious awareness of the planet, at the very least the answers have to be examined and compared. Further they claim that we come here specifically to learn lessons or teach lessons. Often the lessons are related to something we individually are working on, sometimes they’re related to lessons or teachings we are working on with our “soul group” - those individuals we often incarnate with. They too might have chosen a lifetime that relates to an overall theme - like “addiction” or “courage” or “letting go.” It depends upon the themes that the soul group is working on together,like a university class, or a doctoral thesis for an entire group of people. But they also claim that we can say “no” to a particular suggestion of a lifetime, the suggestion being made by our guides and counselors, friends and loved ones. So that’s an element as well. It’s not like we are forced to come here (by karma or some other source) but it’s that we choose to come here because we “think we can handle it” or “believe we can learn or teach lessons this time around.” This is not a theory, belief or philosophy. It is just what people consistently say while under deep hypnosis about the journey of souls. And they say each lifetime is a choice that we make with our guides and loved ones. So it’s really up to you to answer the question individually. Why did you choose this lifetime? What is the meaning of your life? I’ve found that when asking this question while under deep hypnosis, the question of “why did I choose this lifetime?” the answer is often relatively the same. “I came to teach (or learn) lessons in love.” Lessons in “forgiveness” or “courage,” “Letting go” or giving love “unconditionally” to others. In all the cases I’ve examined, people claim that those individuals they meet along with way who seem disruptive are often doing so at the behest of others. As if they “asked” those people to play difficult roles in their lives so they could learn lessons in how to overcome those events. I know why I claim to have come here. I know why I “chose this lifetime” as I’ve witnessed myself making the argument as to why I would come here. So the answer to the question “what is the meaning of life?” can only be answered or understood once we truly examine what life is, why choose to come here to participate in it, and how that choice affects us and others. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message Most of us have no clue what we want to do with our lives. Even after we finish school, even after we get a job , even after we start making money, we fail to clearly define what we want from this life. It’s a struggle almost every adult goes through in life. “What do I want to do with my life” ?”What I’m passionate about”? Because there are so many answers to this question, it’s important to find that resonates us like , some say :— • The meaning of life is to be happy, • The meaning of life is to be at peace with yourself, • The meaning of life is developing feeling of contentment , • The meaning of life is serving humanity, • The meaning of life is to leave legacy, • The meaning of life is to love others, • The meaning of life is to create your own meaning, • The meaning of life is to make a positive difference, • The meaning of life is to have a variety of experiences, • The meaning of life is to find something important enough to justify sufferings . I mean , the concept for “meaning of life” is endless, people interpreting things as per their wisdom & thoughts , making spirituality a complex ,conflicting , chaotic & mysterious experience in itself. Part of the problem is the concept of “life meaning ”itself . The idea that we’re each born for some higher purpose & now it’s our cosmic mission to find it is the shitty logic used to justify things. People come to wonder about the meaning of life for a number of different reasons. May be they are inherently curious, or they have recently experienced a family tragedy, may be they’re questioning their faith or they are going through a depression or pressures in life & are looking for a renewed sense of meaning to escape the sufferings. So, when people say, “what should I do with life”? or “what’s the meaning of life” ? What they are actually asking is” What can I do with my time that’s important?” This is definitely a better question to ask. It’s far more manageable & it doesn’t have all the ridiculous baggage that the “ life meaning ” question demands. There’s no reason for us to be contemplating the cosmic significance of our life while sitting on a couch all day eating potatoes. Rather we should get off our ass & discover what feels important to us & go for it.Basically discovering meaning in our lives should be something that’s fun & interesting & not a chore. Truth is , we exist on this planet for some determined period of time & we do things during the time available to us .Some of these are important & Some are not. The important things that we do gives our lives meaning & happiness while the unimportant ones just kill time. Everything sucks, some of the time.Everything involves some sort of struggle & sacrifice . There’s is no free lunch on earth. Nothing is goody- goody all the time. It’s our ability to handle our struggles, the rough patches of our life, our tolerance threshold that determines the person that we become ultimately. Suppose we want to become a brilliant doctor or a lawyer or a tech entrepreneur or a professional artist but we can’t handle failure, embarrassment,if we can’t stand 90 hrs work week then definitely we’re not going to make it far. What unpleasant experiences in life we are capable of handling, make us what we become in future. If you avoid anything that embarrass you, then you are done away with instantly. It all comes back to vulnerability. Living a life avoiding embarrassment is akin to living a life with your head in the sand . Great things are , by their very nature, unique & unconventional. To achieve them , we must go against the herd mentality. And to do that is scary but do it . Find a problem you care about & start solving it. What most people fail to understand is that the passion is the result of action, not the cause of it. Discovering what you are passionate about in life & what matters to you is a trial & error process. We exactly don’t know how it feels to do the activity until we actually do the activity. Most of us don’t like thinking about death.It freaks us out. But thinking about our own death surprisingly has a lot of practical advantages. One of those is it forces us to zero in on what’s actually important in our lives & what’s just frivolous & distracting. Ultimately death only gives us perspective on the value of our life. Because it’s only by imagining our non-existence that we can get a sense of what’s most important about our existence & hence meaning of our life. When people have no sense of direction , no meaning in life , it’s because they have not identified their goals in life. And when we don’t know the values of our lives,we live with the priorities of others , instead of our own . Take it Easy! Just Chill. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

These depend in turn on us humans having access to three things: food, sex and shelter. But these are worthless unless our access to them is sustainable. Which is why evolution has hardwired three fundamental needs into us:  * need for control * need for connection * need for consistency These needs are still with us today. They drive everything we think, say, feel, decide and do. At the most basic level, they help us survive and reproduce. At a higher level, they set the scene, once we’ve answered them for any length of time, for conditions such as happiness, comfort, satisfaction or serenity.  Why do people think, say, feel, decide and do the things they do? They’re answering three fundamental needs shared by all human beings: control, connection and consistency, or what I call the ‘3Cs of why’. The ‘3Cs of why’ helped our distant ancestors survive physically. Today they help us ‘survive’ psychologically. You’re about to learn more about them. Reading time: 15 minutes. Bonus: by addressing other people’s fundamental needs for control, connection and consistency, we can influence them more effectively.I’ve had a passion for influence factors and techniques for four decades and been implementing and/or teaching them—usually under the title ‘communication’—for well over half that. The 3Cs of why emerged almost accidentally from those activities. I didn’t discover them myself, of course, but I brought them together and decided to study the mix. What I’m offering here is a dispassionate, research-based way to interpret (and influence) human behaviour. It helps me every single day of my life and is enthusiastically received by the people I train. If you’re looking for religious leaps of faith or any form of spiritual guidance here, you won’t find them. What you will find are reasonable assumptions about how our distant ancestors thought and behaved, and humility about what most of us can achieve. The 3Cs of why > Contents 1.

How to explore your personal relationship with control, connection and consistency8. What about happiness, comfort, satisfaction and serenity?9. What about the arts?10. What about religion?  1. Why are control, connection and consistency such fundamental needs in our lives? Roll your mind back 20′000 years and consider the situation of our ancestors. To the best of our knowledge (and without getting into a debate about ‘how it all started’), evolution had already hardwired our ancestors for two things: survival and reproduction.Survival and reproduction depended in turn on our ancestors having access to food, sex, and shelter. But was it that simple? On closer inspection, sustainable access to food, sex and shelter depended on other things:  * Our ancestors needed food but they also needed it all year round, including during tough winters with snow on the ground. This meant they needed to find ways, however rudimentary, to store and protect their food. Those who didn’t died. Our ancestors thus needed to control their food supply. * They felt urges to have sex, but sex didn’t happen just like that. Access to females was restricted by possessive (and aggressive) family and tribe members. If access to females wasn’t possible through violence, it had to be negotiated. This in turn required social skills, however rudimentary. Our ancestors thus needed to connect with each other. And not just for sex. Their ability to connect helped them band together for more efficient hunting and child-rearing purposes. * Shelter could not be found, protected and shared without initiative, organization and social skills. Our ancestors needed both control and connection to achieve this. * None of the above could have happened without our ancestors being able to identify and memorize consistent links between causes and effects or between clues and meaning. For example, they needed to work out that by keeping certain foods dry or cool, they could save it for later. An awareness of consistencies and an instinct to look for them were crucial to our ancestors’ ability to learn, reason, decide, remember and predict—indeed to think. Therefore control, connection and consistency were needs that were just as fundamental to our ancestors, if not more so, as food, sex and shelter. Evolution hardwired them as needs into us, too.All this was true 20′000 years ago. The kicker is that, thanks to evolution, our needs for control, connection and consistency still rule our lives today. They still drive just about everything we do, feel and think. Examples:  * Control *  * Imagine a stranger walking up to you in the street, giving you 100 dollars and walking away without a word of explanation. Your surprise and perhaps a touch of paranoia will soon be replaced by satisfaction. Let’s assume you’re experiencing 50 units of satisfaction units. * Now imagine a different stranger three years later. He walks up to you as you’re checking your wallet, snatches 100 dollars from it and runs away. * Your initial surprise will soon be replaced by dissatisfaction. Logically, given that the sum of money is identical in both cases, you should be experiencing 50 units of dissatisfaction.  * But are you? If you think you’d be more dissatisfied in the second scenario than you were satisfied in the first, you’re not alone. Research has shown that our dissatisfaction at losing something is at least twice as high as our satisfaction at winning. This is our need for control (in this case our fear of losing it) at work. * Connection *  * You’re sitting in a meeting. The boss has just explained his plan to solve a problem. You think it’s total bullshit. It will never work. That should be obvious to anyone. * You look around, expecting to see looks on people’s faces that are at least as disapproving as yours. But you can’t see any. Everyone seems relaxed. * So you raise your hand and politely tell the boss that you don’t think his plan will work. You give it to him straight, even though he’s a sensitive sort of guy. That’s what you would do, right?  * Wrong. You stay quiet. This is your need for connection at work. You don't want to stand out, to rock the boat. You decide that maintaining your connection with your colleagues and your boss — being a team player in today’s jargon — is more important than the truth. *  * And even if you do have the courage to speak up, you won’t do so before experiencing a flash of doubt, of queasiness, of aversion to disconnection.  * Consistency *  * She says ‘yes’ to a dance with him. It goes well but nothing special. * She says ‘yes’ to a drink. * And ‘yes’ to another. * In so doing, she also says ‘yes’ but without pronouncing the word to his curiosity by answering his cliché questions. * When he first puts his hand on hers and tries to leave it there, she moves her hand away. That’s a ‘no’. * But when he does it again, she doesn’t move her hand away. She is cringing but she leaves her hand nnder his. So ‘yes’. * He manages a funny remark. She laughs. That’s a ‘yes’ to his humour.  * One final drink? Just a soda, she says. Another ‘yes’. *  * Now they’re outside the bar and he’s offering to drive/walk her home. ‘Yes’ to that. * More humour from his as they walk. More smiles from her. Not a ‘no’ in sight. * Now she’s outside her home. He asks if he can kiss her. * Yes or no? Strictly speaking, a kiss would have nothing to do with anything that went before. It’s unrelated. Yet somehow it is. A ‘no’ at this stage would seem to contradict, even though it doesn’t, all preceding responses and reactions—all those spoken and unspoken yesses. No one likes to be thought of as a flip-flopper. * This kind of discomfort is our need for consistency at work. It’s the reason men and women stay in broken marriages. It’s the reason people keep on investing in lost causes. To suddenly say ‘no’ would be an admission that all previous decisions were mistakes.  2. Psychological survival has replaced physical survivalOur needs for control, connection and consistency have evolved. They now express themselves differently. The main difference between our distant ancestors and ourselves is that 21st-century ‘survival’ is no longer a physical challenge for most of us. It’s a psychological one:  * threatening complexity has replaced threatening wildlife * dying for something to eat has replaced dying from not eating * exposure to judgment has replaced exposure to elements * scarcity of meaning has replaced scarcity of anything else * the tyranny of appearance has replaced the tyranny of subsistence * contagious loneliness has replaced contagious illnessThis switch from physical to psychological priorities has added levels of complexity to our survival and reproduction instincts. While our needs for control, connection and consistency still help us find food, sex and shelter, they now also drive us to:  * exploit 21st-century opportunities (where’s my start-up? Have you downloaded my app?) * manage 21st-century threats (what do you mean, ‘no wifi’?) * communicate and influence effectively (why did I get only 1 ‘like’ when I have 2538 ‘friends?’) * keep up with whoever or whatever (where are the fortune and fame the world owes me just because I’m alive, connected, reachable, sharable and high on Adderall?) * stay sane (where’s my antidepressant?) * and, if there’s any time left, achieve whatever else we consider important, both for ourselves and those we care about. Answering our fundamental needs simultaneously, sustainably and (where legal and possible) enjoyably is a pre-condition for experiencing states such as satisfaction, happiness, comfort or serenity. On the other hand, whenever one or several of the needs goes unanswered or is threatened for any length of time, it quickly takes precedence in our lives and either taints, disrupts, destroys or slows down our other wants and needs. And it’s no surprise that countless techniques are on offer to help people with unanswered fundamental needs ‘take a step back’, ‘live in the moment’ or ‘see the bigger picture’- Let’s take a closer look at each of our three fundamental needs. 3. Our need for control. A closer look.Our need for control explains our attraction to things like knowledge, food, shelter, freedom, choice, power, possessions, contracts, insurance, mastery and safety. But it also explains our attraction to risk taking, fortune telling and novelty, all of which are opportunities, real or imagined, to test or improve our control. On the other hand, losing control over our life or indeed loss of any kind, whether real or potential (e.g. the prospect of scarcity), is something we avoid and act on. Loss of weight is an exception. 4. Our need for connection. A closer look.Our need for connection is fundamental because there is very little—including reproduction, of course—that we can achieve alone. Evolution has hardwired us to assume we stand a better chance of surviving by collaborating with others, reciprocating and being sociable (watch how newborn babies instinctively attract attention, for instance). As groups we can produce more food, build safer shelters and defend each other. Attraction, seduction and sexual desire are among the most obvious manifestations of our need to connect. By making them pleasurable, evolution has increased the chances that we’ll have sex and produce, in many cases, descendants. But producing children isn’t enough. It takes a tribe, including its homosexual members, to raise them. Besides connecting with other people, we need to feel connected to the world around us, to what we do in it, to what events and things mean, to who we are and to who we might become (self-actualization). This is why emotions and stories, not facts and numbers, resonate so deeply with us. On the other hand, isolation or exclusion, whether real or potential, are forms of disconnection we instinctively fear and may go to extremes to avoid. They explain our reluctance to disobey authority and the darker sides of groupthink and conformity. 5. Our need for consistency. A closer look.Our need for consistency supports our needs for control and connection. How can we spot threats to our control and connections? How can we spot opportunities to test and improve them? By constantly checking our surroundings for breaks in the consistencies we know about. Consciously or not, we spend most of our waking hours filling gaps, spotting patterns, finding or inventing explanations for things (scientific explanations, religious explanations…), drawing conclusions, identifying truths, learning stuff and establishing rules. Consistency underpins all these things and our appetite for it is unlimited. On any given day, we look for consistency between:  * clues and meaning * patterns and meaning * thoughts and other thoughts * thoughts and acts * current acts or thoughts and previous ones * our self of yesterday and the one of today (persistentce of identity) * our ideal self and the one we show (appearances) * our behaviour and applicable rules of any kind, written or unwritten * new information and existing knowledge (learning) * cause and effect * choices or judgments to be made and mental shortcuts (also known as cognitive biases or heuristics, e.g. ‘he’s good-looking and therefore trustworthy’ or ‘he has the same first name as me and is therefore likable’) * expectations and reality The world might seem to be in a turmoil of change, but most of life is actually consistent. We know from observation and learning that the same causes have the same effects and that reality in its millions of tiny details is mostly consistent with our expectations. And it remains so from one minute, day or month to the next. This offers a crucial advantage: anything or anyone we know to be consistent in some way can be safely ignored in most cases. This in turn frees up our mind to pay attention to inconsistencies. These signal either threats to our control and connections or opportunities to improve them. 6. Influencing others via their needs for control, connection and consistencyIf you want to make your communication more effective and influence others, think about how you could reword or restructure your messages so that they answer one or several of people’s three fundamental needs. Examples:  * Control: ‘This project will increase our margin for manœuvre and keep our future options open. It will give us access to new markets. Any objections to all this freedom?’ * Control: ‘If we don't do this, we’ll miss out on new opportunities. We’ll lose customers and suppliers. You wouldn’t want us to damage the trust of our shareholders, would you?’ * Connection: ‘I know this change is not a comfortable prospect for you and you’ll be leaving dear colleagues and friends behind. But you’ll be surrounded by people who care and who’ll make you feel at home. I will call you every week to check on progress. Does that sound like loneliness to you?’ * Connection: ‘Are you sure you disagree? Everyone else is aligned on this and we’re ready to go. Are you a teamplayer or not? Why all the fuss?’ *  * Note: only use this approach if the person in question is clearly disrupting for disruption’s sake or trying to attract attention to themselves. It they genuinely (and bravely) believe they’re right, give them a chance. It’s not because one person disagrees that everyone else is right.  * Connection: ‘Let me share a story that will make things clearer.” * Connection: ‘Automation will remove the boring, unrewarding aspects of your work and allow you to focus on the meaningful, value-adding ones.’ * Connection: ‘We need your opinion on this.’ * Consistency: ‘There will be changes, of course, but look at what’s not changing: our values, our mission, your working conditions.’ * Consistency: ‘There’s a contradiction here.

      "Message This is an interesting one. The answer came to me after a lot of thought about what is the meaning of life. Thought a lot about it, talked to a few people, searched everywhere inside, few said become a hippie but anyway one day the epiphany occured. Q. What is the purpose of animals in this world? A. They are in their endless struggle to survive and transfer their genes so they keep on living. For us humans, this was the case for a long time. We would struggle for our daily needs and mate because obviously it’s fun and nature made us this way. But with technology, so many things are solved that food is no issue, shelter is no issue, we aren’t at threat from anything. So the man asks what is my purpose because the basic needs of the animal inside us is all met. But this doesn’t change the fact that there’s no purpose in life. Our level of consciousness only finds everything meaningless because we know we’ll die and nothing really matters. After this I personally found getting back to life a bit challenging. Read a lot and came to the word Empathy. I think it is the most important word in my life right now. Everyone around us who is content has a purpose and that purpose falls in the realm of our daily problems. We won’t get a different answer just because we asked the deeper question. :D There’s no purpose to life. Just the way Sisyphus accepted it. Find your rolling stone. Search for empathy in things. We are made to connect with others and that greatly has served us humans as a race to grow. Every invention is to solve the pain of someone else. Right?

But I was happy, I studied hard scored good marks and made my parents happy. Nothing else mattered. But it was just one day I fainted and these fainting sessions happened many a times . My teachers didn't wanted me to attend school as I had regular episodes of fainting and breathlessness. Everyone suggested my parents that for some time I should take a break and should visit doctors and take time to heal. Even till now I don't know what happened with me. Those were the dark days of my life. I used to cry every night when I was unable to move and breathe and my voice would be stucked in my throat. I was so tired of my suffering that one day I asked my mother “ mommy why don't god just kill me instead of torturing me every day\" to which she replied “ Beta( my child) god is testing you , he is taking your exam and you always pass your exams with good marks and I am sure you are strong enough to pass this one as well and you know God always takes exam of those whom he thinks as worthy of it. And sometimes to make us strong\" I wasn't much convinced but I had my saviour with me. I took so many medicines but this fainting will always be there . Somehow I met a great doctor and his medicines were effective and I became stable with in a month . Actually I skipped 3–4 months of my school and tuition and every one was unsure whether I will pass 9th or not as I couldn't appear for half yearly exams ( which has the maximum weightage apart from final exams) . I reappeared the exams and passed with good enough marks . The lesson I learned: 1. life is too short so live it to the fullest. 2. Love yourself and every one. 3. Don't be too quick to judge someone. 4. There will always be ups and downs in life and that's what make our life more interestin 5. The past is in the past, just move on and forgive those who had hurt you because you will gain nothing by having a grudge against them. P.s during the treatment I have to cut down my mid back long hair and since then I always liked short hair. has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

      "Message This is actually something to discover, not something to theorize about. You have to watch, in a detached manner, so that you can find out what manifests itself as meaningful to you. You can learn to do this. You can start by watching yourself for a couple of weeks. Assume you do not know who you are, but that you would like to find out. Notice when you say or do something that makes you unhappy or self-conscious or disgusted with yourself. Stop saying and doing those things. Notice, as well, when you say or do something that makes you feel more engaged, stronger, and less self-conscious. Say and do more of those things. This watching and noticing is more of an embodied or incarnate phenomena than an abstract conceptualization. Saying and doing things properly -- for you -- will bring together your disparate and warring parts, and improve your temper. Such an exercise produces an experience of deep-rooted solidity, at approximately the level of the solar plexus, rather than the experience of fallling apart. That solidity is the philosopher's stone.  You will have to sacrifice many of your deepest rooted convictions to correctly perform the exercise described above correctly. Many of the things that make you unhappy or self-conscious or disgusted will be things that you wish you could happily do -- but you can't. The joke's on you.

      "Message Most of the answers to this question are religious or just plain bullshit about a spiritual journey to achieve happiness. (Massive disappointment and depression ahead; proceed with caution) . . . Disregarding religion — if you are religious just stop reading now because you will not believe anything I am about to say. The universe is infinite but will only be infinite for a finite amount of time. That's a very difficult concept to grasp but eventually, galaxies will collide and then black holes will surround the vast universe everywhere. These black holes will eventually become the only thing that is left in the universe, no life or matter to exist anymore. These black holes will very slowly be dissipated into nothing through hawking radiation then becoming emptiness. When all the planets, stars, galaxies and then black holes are dissolved — the last proton will decay into oblivion and then -- Nothing. There will never be anything again. There's no stopping it. You cant avoid it. You see the reason why everyone on our planet is not depressed or killing themselves over this thought, although a good reason to — it is hardwired in our brains to survive. Climb that rock to get out of a hole, eat your childhood pet to not starve, find someone to multiply/increase odds of human survival, etc. So in the universal perspective, life has no meaning and everything you do. No matter how great or good — will be forgotten or erased forever eventually. In the terms of the natural evolutionary perspective, our meaning is to multiply and survive as long as we can.(Pillars of creation — real photograph) Also I do respect your belief of religion and I hope you respect mine about the universe.

Yet injustice and pain seem to prevail century after century. It is my belief that this is because the world we find ourselves in is actually a virtual reality. An easy way to wrap your head around it is to imagine it's a video game and we are the characters in the game. Our true and higher self resides in the free universe outside of the game. Our lives feel purposeless because we are trapped in this alternate reality and we feel lost because we are disconnected from our higher self. Therefore the real purpose of life is to awaken to this truth. Samadhi. Enlightenment. Once we understand the truth about our false reality then our purpose is simply to reside in peace, connected to our higher self and be the light of truth in a world of darkness. It is because we know it's not ‘real' that allows us to be in the moment, live in the now without agenda because we don't need to prove anything, accomplish anything or do anything other than point others to the truth — with compassion and patience.

Next day, I got a notification from QuoraIn just 16 hours, that answer was able to fetch more than 22k views. It was a remarkable achievement for an immature writer like me. But I got the notification that my answer was collapsed due to violating Quora’s image policy.Although, I appealed for the same but it did not work. I was very disappointed and didn't open Quora for some 7–8 hours. But finally, I decided to move on and written another answer which again surprisingly crossed 20k views in a single day. This situation is quite relatable to our life. Happiness is on our face till everything went smooth. Suddenly, a disasterous moment arrived and our heart broke into pieces. Many people can't handle this situation and happiness is replaced by the depression which eventually turns out to be more disasterous. After every such situation, we are left with two options either quit or face it and move on. If we choose the first option, our remaining life will pass in regret. If we choose the second option, everything will become normal in few days or maybe in few months. Life is full of challenge and its our duty to find the opportunity in every such moment.Life is 10% what happens with you and 90% how you react to it.image source :- quora. cheers…… has been labeled as: ['suicide']\n",

I avoided calling my parents, since calling them only meant talking about mundane things (what did you eat? is your job going okay? etc.). These talks weren't good enough for me, they weren't answering any of my questions. There came a point where I was so disheartened about not finding any answers that I went into depression, not knowing what this life was ultimately leading towards.  During this time one of my friends explained a very good theory to me which helped me gain a little perspective - she said that we have been accustomed to getting a result at the end of every task (we study hard for an exam, we get good grades; we exercise, we become healthy; we do good at work, we get promoted - we have an end goal to look forward to). This notion of knowing that a particular task is leading towards an end goal makes us think that this life is leading somewhere (at least that was my dilemma) and I desperately wanted to know what that end result of living this life would be. I still dont know the answer to that question but I've realized that even if you stop living, life doesn't wait for you. It doesn't come to a halt and wait for you to get back up on your feet - It goes on. This realization hit me hard and I'm still trying to digest the fact that Life will not be soft on me, it will not sympathize with me for not being able to cope up.
